# ToposText Potentially Erroneous Wikidata ID's + Misc. Other Errors
## This document includes entities that have Wikidata ID's that I believe to be erroneous, along with an explanation why, as well as other potential errors.

### Book 5
* (5.6.4) There is a random "24" in the middle of the words.
* (5.6.24) Another random "29"
> Both of these are likely cleaning errors from reformatting.

### Book 6
* (6.3.5) The Wikidata ID linked is for Hegesander of Delphi, some ~150 years after the events of the *Anabasis*.
* (6.5.7) Rhathines should be linked to the Wikidata entry Ratines (Q11944935) (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11944935).

### Book 7
* (7.3.28) The Wikidata ID linked is for Gnesippus, the Doric poet, while the Gnesippus mentioned by Xenophon is an Athenian member of his army. The (admittedly scant) knowledge of dates for Doric Gnesippus means it could theoretically be the same person, as he is potentially alive during the events of the *Anabasis*, but the lack of any other supporting evidence makes this unlikely.
