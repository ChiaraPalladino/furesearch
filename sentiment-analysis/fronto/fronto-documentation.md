### Documentation for Sentiment Analysis on Fronto
This section is intended to document any areas of ambiguity, issues, and final decisions made on specific complicated cases. Make sure to add the relevant references to the sentence (e.g. verse number and sentence number) and to quote the text in question. 
difficult cases: 

93-94

"Da verecundiae veniam , si urgentibus curis praepeditus negotia in manibus praeversus sum , speque tuae erga me benignissimae facilitatis interim in scribendo cessavi."

"Fiduciae amoris ignoscito , si piguit consilia me singularum rerum forsitan in dies mutanda sub incerto adhuc exitu dubia existimatione perscribere."

Fronto is apologetic for his letter arriving. These two were both originally assigned negative scores because both seemed to express sentiments of regret and apology. However, there is a distinction between the two: 93 focuses more on the excuse for why the letter is late- a presentation of fact that he had other business to attend to- while 94 focuses more on Fronto's apology, which has a more emotional and negative sentiment.

124

"Quom tu nullam umquam mercedem ullius rei agendae dicendaeve a quoquam postularis , Fronto iste nullum verbum prius neque frequentius congarrit quam hoc Da , ego contra quod possum , aut chartulas ei aut tabellas porrigo , quarum rerum petitorem eum esse cupio."

Fronto describes his baby grandson as he often saying "Da"- "give". This was a tricky sentence as it could have a negative connotation if Fronto were suggesting the baby was needy, however it was decided to be neutral because the letter does not state Fronto's true feelings on the baby's behaviour. The sentence was also written matter-of-fact-ly.

132

"Verum illos ego luctus toleravi fortius , quibus egomet ipse solus cruciabar . Namque meus animus meomet dolori obnixus , oppositus quasi solitario certamine , unus uni par pari resistebat ."

The overall sentiment of the letter is grief, as it is a eulogy to his recently diseased son. However, this sentence talks about his standing up to and restistance of grief, which has a positive sentiment. 

135 and 137

"Sapiet mea filia : viro omnium quantum est hominum optimo adquiescet : is eam consolabitur pariter lacrimando pariter suspirando pariter loquendo pariter conticiscendo."

"Neque ulla poetarum carmina aut sapientium praecepta tantum promoverint ad luctum filiae meae sedandum et dolorem leniendum , quantum mariti vox ex ore carissimo et pectore iunctissimo profecta."

From the same eulogy. Sentence 35 could have been mixed due to it touching his daughters grief, however, it was determined to be positive because the prevailing sentiment is that her husband is close with her and able to provide emotional support. 137 was likewise determined to be mixed because while the first part of the sentence is very negative, the positive emotions surrounding her husband are enough to make a polar difference. 

171

"Aufidius animos tollit , arbitratum suum in caelum fert , negat se hominem iustiorem , ne quid immoderatius dicam , ex Umbria ullum alium Romam venisse."

This sentence could be a neutral statement, however his use of hyperbole suggests emotional content. Negative was selected as it fits better with the environment of the letter, which indicates a dislike of Aufidius by Aurelius. 

173

"facile esse ait oscitantem iudici assidere , ceterum quidem iudicare praeclarum opus . Haec in me."

This sentence could be mixed due to the work of a judge being described positively as noble, however, negative was selected as the overall segment is an insult to Aurelius. 

190-191

"Illud equidem non temere adiuravero : Si quis iste revera Phaeder fuit , si umquam is a Socrate afuit , non magis Socratem Phaedri desiderio quam me per istos dies , dies dico ?"

"menses inquam , tui adspectus cupidine arsisse ? . . . . amet , nisi confestim tuo amore corripitur ."

These sentences could be taken as positive, if the positive assertion that Aurelius' love for Fronto is stronger than Phaedrus' for Socrates is taken as the main statement. However, the focus of the statement is on longing, and with support from negative vocabulary, the two segments were assigned negative. 

205

"Nam quod dicis liberis meis cavendum esse morte illius , plane liberi mei pereant , si magis amari merebitur Avidius quam illi , et si reipublicae expediet Cassium vivere quam liberos Marci ."

The majority of this letter was assigned neutral as Aurelius is providing a sterile, rational approach to the topic in contrast to Verus' more personal and emotional preceeding letter. Line 205 could be taken positively as Aurelius is stating that Cassius is a full citizen of the state, and that he would rather sacrifice his children than use them as an excuse to kill Cassius. However, it was assigned neutral because it is more of a matter-of-fact statement of what actions Aurelius will take due what reasons, rather than an emotional opinion on Cassius or citizen rights.
