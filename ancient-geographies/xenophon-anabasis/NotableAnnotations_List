# Specific Notable Edge-Case Annotations 
An aggregate for notes that were made during the annotation process. Serves as a resource for better understanding this project's annotation process, and for understanding certain edge-cases. Annotations posted here have been resolved to at the very least a functional extent, while most are fully resolved.

## Book 1:
* 1.2.8 “Great King” I think refers to Artaxerxes II?
> Similar to the “King” debacle, not capitalized in the Greek (μεγάλου βασιλέως), but this is the only instance I’ve seen of “Great King”
> Same instance shows up again in 1.7.13, 1.7.14, 
* 1.2.10 “Lycaean festival” very odd fringe case
> Very confused as to how to annotate this. The Greek here is Λύκαια, which Scaife identifies as the Lycaea, a festival celebrating Zeus Lycaea. Lycaea the festival has an Encyclopaedia Britannica entry, albeit very brief, but there is no corresponding Wikipedia entry (for the festival; there is one for a town of the same name), though it is heavily referenced in the Mount Lykaion and Lycaon (king of Arcadia). So, my best thought would be to either tag it as .event (but that seems more for one time big things, not recurring festivals) or as .miscellaneous, with either optionally having a .mythological tag on it. However, if it comes from Mt Lykaion (or even the town Lycaea), then maybe “Lycaean” would be better tagged as a collective.ethnic?
* 1.2.12 “Cilican queen” 
> The Greek uses just “Κίλισσα” (“a Cilician,” same as referring to any other person of the ethnic group) to refer to her, so I annotated “Cilician queen” as a person and tag it Epyaxa.person (similar to those “the Persian” or “the Greek” instances we’ve run into previously), then nested an annotation of “Cilician” inside of it tagged person.ethnic. This is consistent with annotations for other similar annotations, but this one felt weirder so I wanted to check in
> This same entity also shows up in 1.2.14, 1.2.16, 1,2,18, and 1.2.20
* 1.2.13 “so-called spring of Midas”
> Refers to a stream of water that Midas used to water down wine to catch Silenus. As far as I can tell, this is referenced literally nowhere else, there is definitely no georeference point I can find, but it rides that line between being a mythological location and a real one. I put the .mythological tag on there just in case
* 1.2.13 “the satyr”
> So I know typically we don’t annotate things that aren’t capitalized, but this one is weird because it’s not capitalized in English, but is in Greek (τὸν Σάτυρον). Additionally, it refers to a very specific entity: Silenus. Given that, I went ahead and annotated it, but I wanted to check with you
* 1.4.4 “the Gates between Syria and Cilica”
> This area refers to the Belen Pass, but I’m uncertain as to whether I should annotate the whole string or just “Gates.” “Gates” itself isn’t unambiguous (I confused this area for the Cilician Gates on my first pass months ago) and it isn’t capitalized in Greek, yet it is capitalized in English, and annotating just “Gates” is way more condensed, and this is the only set of gates mentioned in the text, so it is unambiguous within the Anabasis. Given this, I went ahead and just annotated “Gates”
* 1.6.7 “altar of Artemis”
> Originally annotated this as just “Artemis,” but on a second look this might actually be the specific Temple of Artemis at Sardis. Should I annotate the whole string, and maybe do a nesting of “Artemis”?
>
> 
## Book 2: 
 * 2.1.3 "the ruler of Teuthrania" and "the
Laconian" > epithet    
      Explanation (CP):   ὁ Τευθρανίας is an article nom. sg. + placename at the genitive. βασιλεύς (ruler) is implied in this case. So, "king of Teuthrania" is a correct translation. I have indicated this in the comment to the annotation.

* 2.1.5 "the Laconian" and "the Thessalian"
* 2.1.7 "Greek"
* 2.1.10 "the Arcadian" and "the Theban"
* 2.1.11 "Theopompus, an Athenian"
* 2.1.16 "Greek"
* 2.2.7 "the Thracian"
* 2.2.8 "Greek"
> This accidentally got deleted off the document comments, but this refers to "the Greek officers" and Dr. Palladino asked we knew of them:

> It seems that in this usage, officers is a catch-all term for at least the generals and possibly the captains as well. The Greek generals at this point in the book---who are actually mentioned in this book---are: Proxenus the Boeotian, Sophaentus the Stymphalian, Socrates of Achaea, Clearchus, Cheirisophus, and Menon of Thessaly (at this point he hasn't betrayed the Ten Thousand yet and is still Greek), and all of these are known from Book 1 too, where who they command are listed out. Sosis the Syracusan is also said to command 300 hoplites, but he's only mentioned once in the whole text and never brought up again, so it's unclear if he died, deserted, or what. Also, these are not counting Pythagoras of Sparta and Tamos the Egyptian, who commanded trireme fleets (thus probably wouldn't be on land with everybody?), but it's also not clear where they are. Finally, it's unclear if this is a list of all the generals, and this doesn't count the hundreds of different captains who might be considered 'officers,' of whom only a few (like Xanthicles) are named. So, that's all to say, you floated the idea of maybe annotating this differently, but that's all the information I could find, so I defer to you. Right now, I'll keep it as collective.ethnic
* 2.2.20 "the Elean"
* 2.3.18 "Men of Greece" (check Greek on this, it might be necessary to annotate whole string if it's all one word in Greek)
> The Greek uses "ἄνδρες Ἕλληνες" so the translation "Men of Greece" doesn't as clearly capture that it's an adjective ethnic identifier in the original text. Given that "Greek men" is just as reasonable a translation, but "Men" isn't necessary to clarify the "Greek" at all, I annotated just "Greece" as collective.ethnic
* 2.4.13 "Sittace"
> In reviewing how exactly I tag cities Xenophon mentioned (whether to distinguish between city_large vs city vs city_small, etc.) I looked at the Greek which just uses polis and then some adjectives, but no special word for city (πόλις ἦν μεγάλη καὶ πολυάνθρωπος), so given that 'large' and 'populous' are not inherent in the word choice, I will just use a 'city' tag here and for future instances, and the only other one that will be distinguished is 'city_abandoned'
* 2.4.15 "Menon's friend"
> Not clearly resolved yet; the Greek for this sentence is "Μένωνα δὲ οὐκ ἐζήτει, καὶ ταῦτα παρʼ Ἀριαίου ὢν τοῦ Μένωνος ξένου," so both Menon and Ariaeus are mentioned as proper nouns in the phrase, so my guess would be to keep them annotated/tagged as separate individuals?
* 2.4.26 "the Persian"
> From meeting notes: _"The Persian" in 2.4.26 annotate it as if it said something like "Tissaphernes \[\...\] the Persian" but referred to "the Persian" in isolation later, so annotate "the Persian" as a place in recogito, then tag it person.ethnic_. So essentially we're treating it as if it said "Tissaphernes the Persian" all connected. I was also going to put in the Tissaphernes' authoritative name tag for this instance so that we know
> I actually misremembered part of this instance: It's not Tissaphernes, but Cyrus and Artaxerxes' unnamed half-brother. In this case, should I give it any other identifying tag beyond just person.ethnic?
* 2.5.31-33 list of generals
*  2.5.37 more captains
* 2.6.16 "the Boeotian" and "of Leontini"
* 2.6.21 "the Thessalian" 2.6.30 "the Arcadian" and "the Achaean"

## Book 3: 
* 3.1.4 "the Athenian"
* 3.1.5 "..., the Athenian"
* 3.1.5 "Athenian government"
> Correct to annotate it as collective.organization, just don't nest another place annotation of 'Athenian' inside it 
* 3.1.26 "who spoke in the Boeotian dialect"
> mostly one word in Greek (βοιωτιάζων), and obviously meant to identify him, though a slightly odd way of doing it. Right now, we'll annotate "Boeotian" as a .language \[need to review if we'll do language.ethnic?\] because saying "..who spoke Boeotian" would also make sense, and we'd know it'd be a language
* 3.1.31 "the Stymphalian"
* 3.1.34 "the Elean"
* 3.1.45 "\...heard that you were an Athenian"
> This one is a weird instance since it's a quote and thus 'you' and 'Athenian' are both in accusative and 2nd person, so I cannot tell if it would be considered an epithet or not for certain. I went ahead and, while 'Xenophon' is in the vocative and 'Athenian' is accusative, Athenian is obviously in reference to Xenophon, so I annotated it as if it was "Xenophon the Athenian"
* 3.1.47 list of generals again
* 3.2.1 "the Lacedaemonian"
* 3.2.4 "the Orchomenian"
* 3.2.37 "since he is a Lacedaemonian" \[almost certainly collective.ethnic\]
> I made it person.ethnic because in the Greek both Cheirisophus and Lacedaemonian are nominative singular masculine, so even though they're divided by a couple words I think it should be the same as an epithet (ie. Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian)
* 3.3.2 "'Men of Greece'" should maybe be the whole string \[same reasoning as Book 2\]
> The Greek uses "ἄνδρες Ἕλληνες" so the translation "Men of Greece" doesn't as clearly capture that it's an adjective ethnic identifier in the original text. Given that "Greek men" is just as reasonable a translation, I annotated it as collective.ethnic
* 3.3.5 "the Arcadian"
* 3.3.20 "Lycius, the son of Polystartus" another weird nesting instance (like with Glus) and "an Athenian" immediately after, since it's an identifier
* 3.4.47 "the Sicyonian"
* 3.5.5 "men of Greece" conundrum once more
> See previous instances

## Book 4:
* 4.1.2 “Carduchian mountains” might actually need to be a location annotation?
> “Carduchian mountains” must be annotated with one string and tagged as Corduene
 4.1.18 “the Laconian” and “the Arcadian”
* 4.1.27-28 soldier volunteer list
* 4.2.13 three captain list + their fathers
* 4.2.17 “the Argive”
* 4.2.21 “of Lusi”
* 4.2.28 “by a Cretan named Stratocles” there was a similar note in book 2 about referring to Tissaphernes as “the Persian” I think? Might have to be annotated differently
> Checked the Greek, and it does use Cretan as an epithet, so I annotated it as person.ethnic
* 4.4.15 “of Temnus”
* 4.4.19 “the Stymphalian” 
* 4.5.24 “an Athenian”
* 4.5.34 “Persian-speaking”
> Annotated this as a language; felt similar to dealing with the ‘he who spoke Boeotian” earlier
* 4.6.1 “of Amphipolis”
* 4.6.9 “Cleanor” not a place, just weird that cleanor isn’t specified
* 4.6.20 “of Methydrium” “the Chian” “the Oetaean”
* 4.7.8-12 list of soldier volunteers
* 4.7.13 “of Stymphalus”
* 4.7.24 “The Sea! The Sea!”
> I brought this up elsewhere, but debated tagging this with the wikipedia page for that phrase. However, upon relooking at it, it’s unnecessary to tag at all, not even as a location, since θάλαττα isn’t even capitalized in the Greek
* 4.8.18 “the Acarnanian” “of Orchomenus”
* 4.8.25 “a Spartan”

## Book 5: 
* Neon the Asinaean (5.3.4); I am unsure which Pleiades entry I should correspond “the Asinaean” to. The options are either Asine (Messenia) (pleiades:570125), which is a city on the Messenian Gulf, or Asinaeus (pleiades:570123) which corresponds to the Asinaean Gulf itself (alt. way to refer to the Messenian Gulf, derived from the city itself. 
> It’s ambiguous whether Xenophon intends to indicate that Neon is from the city Asine itself, or just from the region that happens to borrow its name
> Erring on the side of being more general than specific, I am selecting the latter, and will be linking the Messenian Gulf page (though tagging it as Asinaean Gulf)
* (5.3.5) “treasury of the Athenians at Delphi” this is a long annotation, but it refers directly to a specific building that is logged in Pleiades, so I am going to annotate the whole string (though not nest anything in it) as a place
* (5.3.6) “Asia”; there is a question of what he meant by Asia, and then consequently how to tag it in Pleiades.
> I’ve chosen to associate this annotation with Asia Minor, as Xenophon is jumping forward in time beyond the Anabasis to, referencing is participation in the campaign of Agesilaus II in Ephesus, in order to tie up a loose end about his votive offering.
> This means that, for Wikipedia linkage, I am linking this to Anatolia (as the page for Asia Minor redirects here)
* (5.4.15) Metropolis: There is a city of the Mossynoecians referred to as the proper noun “Metropolis” twice, and is a city the Ten Thousand visit. It is capitalized in Scaife’s Greek as well, but my first impression is that this is a nickname, shorthand, or pure invention by Xenophon. Pleiades does not have a Metropolis that appears to be anywhere near where they should be, and likewise there is no wikipedia info, and ToposText does not even have a link in it
> This will have to be better researched. I believe the Mossynoeciens are another ambiguous ethnic group, and this may be another Chalybes/Chaldians problem. Hopefully there will be some decent scholarship on this
> For now I have left it unlocated, unlinked, and flagged it as ambiguous
