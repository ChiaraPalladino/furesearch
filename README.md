# FU Research - Undergraduate Research in Digital and Computational Classics at Furman University

## How to use this repository

This repository collects all the ongoing projects by Furman students. 

### Bugs, questions and issues
For any issue related to your project, questions or bugs, you should use the GitHub Issues feature: https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/issues. 
* Open a new issue if the problem is new, or reply to an existing one if the problem persists.
* **Remember to use the appropriate label for any issue you open**: https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/labels
* In your issue, indicate _exactly_ the problem. If the question is related to a specific sentence or textpart, paste the text in question within the issue. If the question is a bug, describe the bug at best of your ability. 
* **Only close an existing issue if you think the problem has been completely solved**.  

### Longer discussions and problems 
If you have a topic you would like to bring to everyone's attention, you may use the GitHub discussions feature: https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/discussions. 

This feature is useful for showing stuff you have done, or for extended discussions related to things you have discovered, or for the description of milestones you have reached. I recommend using https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/discussions/categories/milestones-show-and-tell for describing weekly tasks you have completed.
