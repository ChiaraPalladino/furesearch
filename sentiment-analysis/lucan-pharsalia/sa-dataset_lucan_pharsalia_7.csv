510 - 513,124,"illīc quaeque suō miscet gēns proelia tēlō, Rōmānus cūnctīs petitur cruor: inde sagittae, inde facēs et saxa volant spatiōque solūtae āeris et calidō liquefactae pondere glandēs",Neutral,"Each soldier wielded his usual weapons, all alike after\Roman blood, with flights of arrows, brands and stones,\and weighted bullets melted and fused by their passage.",,,2

",2
535 - 537,129,"utinam, Pharsālia, campīs sufficiat cruor iste tuīs quem barbara fundunt pector",Neutral,"Would that Pharsalia’s plain might have been content\with the blood of foreigners, theirs the gore that stained\her springs, ",,,1

548 - 549,133,nōn illīc rēgum auxiliīs collēcta iuventūs bella gerit ferrumque manūs mōvēre rogātae,Negative,Those who plied arms and waged war there were not men\drawn as auxiliaries from foreign armies; here men faced\fathers and brothers.,,There is a sense of despair as the indivduals are being forced to fight their own people there is a sense of deep regret that is felt through having to fight against ones own people. ,
552 - 554,134,"hanc fuge, mēns, partem bellī tenebrīsque relinque, nūllaque tantōrum discat mē vāte malōrum quam multum bellīs liceat cīvīlibus aetās",Negative,"Would that my mind might\shun these acts of war, give them to darkness, that no age\might learn from me, in verse, of such horrors, or the full\depths of civil conflict.",,"(CP) i think this is negative. the lexicon is quite telling and the desire to forget does not express hope, but the lack of choice in this circumstance",1
557 - 559,135,"hīc Caesar, rabiēs populīs stimulusque furōrum, nē quā parte suī pereat scelus, agmina circum it vagus atque ignēs animīs flagrantibus addit",Negative,"For Caesar, rousing his soldiers’ madness and fury, went\here and there among the lines, adding fire to their burning\ardour, so that nowhere was free of guilt",,,2
560 - 565,136,"īnspicit et gladiōs, quī tōtī sanguine mānent, quī niteant prīmō tantum mucrōne cruentī, quae pressō tremat ēnse manus, quis languida tēla, quis contenta ferat, quis praestet bella iubentī, quem pugnāre iuvet, quis vultum cīve perēmptō mūtet",Negative,"He noted whose\blade was all blood, whose glittered with only its tip red,\whose sword-hand trembled, whose grip on his spear was\firm, whose was slack, who delighted in warfare, and who\merely obeyed orders, whose countenance changed when\he killed a countryman",,Lucan is clearly communicating that there was no positive soilder in this war. There were those being forced to simply obey and then those who were enjoying killing - regardless there is not a positive to either type of soilder,1
567 - 571,137,"quācumque vagātur, sanguineum velutī quatiēns Bellōna flagellum Bistonas aut Māvors agitāns sī verbere saevō Palladiā stimulet turbātōs aegide currūs, nox ingēns scelerum est",Neutral,"Like Bellona brandishing the blood-stained scourge, or\like Mars urging on the Bistones, lashing his horses with\savage blows as they run in fear of Pallas and her aegis,",,,1

",,"(CP) I think the translation is suggesting a sentiment that is not as clear in the Latin. The lexicon is much more negative in english, and there is a ton of addition of detail that is not even in the original. This is still negative because of caedes and gemitus, but pay attention to this because there is no equivalent to darkness, crime or slaughter in Latin (caedes is not as charged) ",1
574 - 575,139,ipse manū subicit gladiōs ac tēla ministrat adversōsque iubet ferrō cōnfundere vultūs,Negative,"His the hands\that grant fresh blades, new missiles, commanding that\they hack with swords the faces of the foe. ",,,2
576 - 577,140,"prōmovet ipse aciēs, impellit terga suōrum, verbere conversae cessantīs excitat hastae",Neutral,"He himself\leads the advance and, urging on the stragglers, rouses\the laggards with blows from the butt-end of his spear.",,,1
578 - 581,141,"in plēbem vetat īre manūs mōnstratque senātum: scit cruor imperiī quī sit, quae vīscera rērum, unde petat Rōmam, lībertās ultima mundī quō steterit ferienda locō",Negative,"Telling them to spare the rank and file, he points out\to them the senators, knowing the arteries of the state,\the heart of power, how to strike at Rome, and where\Liberty might be wounded, making her last stand here.",,,2
581 - 585,142,"permixta secundō ōrdine nōbilitās venerandaque corpora ferrō urguentur: caedunt Lepidōs caeduntque Metellōs Corvīnōsque simul Torquātaque nōmina, rērum saepe ducēs summōsque hominum tē, Magne, remōtō",Neutral,"Senators, knights and noblemen are put to the sword;\The Lepidi and Metelli are slain, the Corvini, the house\of Torquatus, once leaders of the state, ruling all men\Pompey, except only you.",,seems to be descriptive ,2
593 - 595,143,"nōndum attigit arcem, iūris et hūmānī columen quō cūncta premuntur ēgressus meruit fātīs tam nōbile lētum",Positive,"To aim at Caesar’s life\is useless here: he has not reached the summit yet, not\risen far enough beyond those lawful heights of human\power that constrain all, to earn of fate so noble a death.",,,
597 - 598,144,hīc patriae perit omne decus: iacet aggere magnō patricium campīs nōn mixtā plēbe cadāver,Negative,"There all the glory of our country perished: a great pile\of noble corpses, unmixed with common soldiers lay\there on that field. ",,,0
599 - 601,145,"mors tamen ēminuit clārōrum in strāge virōrum pugnācis Domitī, quem clādēs fāta per omnīs dūcēbant",Mixed,"Yet one death was most noteworthy\in that carnage, that of Domitius, the stubborn warrior,\whom fate led from defeat to defeat",,While at first inspection I felt that the sentiment of this senentece was negative there seems to be glory established.,1
602 - 604,146,vīctus totiēns ā Caesare salvā lībertāte perit: tunc mīlle in vulnera laetus lābitur ac veniā gaudet caruisse secundā,Mixed,"Conquered so often by Caesar,\still he died here without loss of his liberty.Thus he fell\to a host of wounds, glad not to suffer a second pardon.",,Even though he faced defeat and death he died with his freedom in tact. ,2
605 - 607,147,"vīderat in crassō versantem sanguine membra Caesar, et increpitāns ‘iam Magnī dēseris arma, successor Domitī",Negative,"Caesar found him weltering in a pool of blood, taunting\him: ‘Domitius, my successor in Gaul, now you desert\Pompey’s cause",,,2
608 - 613,148,"ast illī suffēcit pectora pulsāns spīritus in vōcem morientiaque ōra resolvit: ‘nōn tē fūnestā scelerum mercēde potītum sed dubium fātī, Caesar, generōque minōrem aspiciēns Stygiās Magnō duce līber ad umbrās et sēcūrus eō",Positive,"So he spoke, but the courage still beating in Domitius’\breast sufficed for speech; in dying he opened his lips:\‘The fatal reward for your crimes, is not yet yours,\Caesar! Knowing your fate is undecided, and your\inferiority to your son-in-law, I go free, untroubled,\to the Stygian shades, with Pompey still my leader.",,This sentence is interesting. The indivdial is dying but he is dying without fear and with courage. This seems to be a death with glory being added to the indivduals cause. This leads me to classify the sentence as positive. ,
613 - 615,149,"tē saevō Mārte subāctum Pompeiōque gravīs poenās nōbīsque datūrum, cum moriar, spērāre licet",Negative,"Though I die, I yet can hope that you, submerged\by savage conflict, will pay Pompey and myself\a heavy reckoning.’",,Since this falls in the context of a curse the sentence is negative. ,1
617 - 622,150,"impendisse pudet lacrimās in fūnere mundī mortibus innumerīs, ac singula fāta sequentem quaerere lētiferum per cuius vīscera vulnus exierit, quis fūsa solō vītālia calcet, ōre quis adversō dēmissum faucibus ēnsem expulerit moriēns animā",Negative,"When a whole world died there, it seems shameful\to spend tears on each of the innumerable dead,\follow individual fates to ask whose vital organs\the death-dealing sword penetrated, who trampled\on his own bloody entrails, who facing his enemy\pulled the buried blade from his own throat, with\his last gasp, in dying. ",,,2
625 - 626,151,quis cruor ēmissīs perrūperit āera vēnīs inque hostis cadat arma suī,Neutral,"some fell on the enemy weapons, spouting blood\from their veins;",,While violent there does not seem to be a negative sentiment attached here. ,1
626 - 630,152,"quis pectora frātris caedat et, ut nōtum possit spoliāre cadāver, abscīsum longē mittat caput, ōra parentis quis laceret nimiāque probet spectantibus īrā quem iugulat nōn esse patrem",Negative,"one stabbed his brother’s breast,\then to spoil the body of his kin, severed the head\and flung it far off; while another slashed at his\father’s face, trying in wild fury to show those\looking-on the man he slew was not his father.",,,
632 - 634,153,"nōn istās habuit pugnae Pharsālia partēs quās aliae clādēs: illīc per fāta virōrum, per populōs hīc Rōma perit",Negative,"This\battle of Pharsalia was different than all other\disasters: Rome suffered many deaths elsewhere,\here Rome perished in the deaths of nations;",,,
638 - 641,154,"maius ab hāc aciē quam quod sua saecula ferrent vulnus habent populī, plūs est quam vīta salūsque quod perit: in tōtum mundī prōsternimur aevum, vincitur hīs gladiīs omnis quae serviet aetās",Negative,"The nations in this conflict were dealt\a wound too heavy for their age alone to bear;\here more than simply life and limb it was that\perished: we were laid low for centuries, all\generations doomed to slavery were conquered\by those swords.",,,
642 - 645,155,proxima quid subolēs aut quid meruēre nepōtēs in rēgnum nāscī? pavidē num gessimus arma tēximus aut iugulōs? aliēnī poena timōris in nostrā cervīce sedet,Negative,"What fault did we, their sons,\their grandsons, commit that we deserved to be\born under tyranny? Did we fight fearfully or\shield our throats from the sword? The guilt\for others’ cowardice is pinned to our necks.",,,
647 - 649,156,"iam Magnus trānsīsse deōs Rōmānaque fāta sēnserat īnfēlīx, tōtā vix clāde coāctus fortūnam damnāre suam",Negative,"By now, wretched Pompey had realised the god’s\no longer favoured him, nor was the fate of Rome\in his hands, compelled against his will by such\disaster to despair of his fortunes.",,,0
649 - 651,157,"stetit aggere campī, ēminus unde omnīs sparsās per Thessala rūra aspiceret clādēs quae bellō obstante latēbant",Negative,"He stood far off\on rising ground, from where he saw the carnage\grip a Thessaly darkened by the clouds of battle.",,,1

654 - 655,159,"nec, sīcut mōs est miserīs, trahere omnia sēcum mersa iuvat gentēsque suae miscēre ruīnae",Negative,"Yet he did not delight, as the wretched so often do,\in drawing the whole world to destruction with him,\and involving all mankind in his ruin.",,,1
656 - 659,160,"ut Latiae post sē vīvat pars maxima turbae sustinuit dignōs etiamnunc crēdere vōtīs caelicolās vōvitque, suī sōlācia cāsūs: ‘parcite,’ ait ‘superī, cūnctās prōsternere gentēs",Mixed,"He still saw\the gods as deserving of his prayer that the majority\of Romans might survive him, a solace to him in\his downfall. ‘Refrain, you gods,’ he cried, ‘from\the destruction of the nations. ",,"Given the criteria that we established for dealing with prayers, I fell that this sentence should be mixed. His plea does not necessarily feel as if it is rooted in fear but the argument can be made that he is fearful for the future of Rome and that is the emotion leading to his prayer. ",0
663 - 666,161,"cīvīlīne parum est bellō, sī mēque meōsque obruit? exiguae clādēs sumus orbe remōtō? omnia quid lacerās? quid perdere cūncta labōrās? iam nihil est, Fortūna, meum",Negative,"Is it not enough\that this civil war has destroyed me and mine. Is all\the world’s destruction insufficient? Why lacerate\all things? Why work at universal destruction? Now,\nothing of mine is left me, Fortune.’",,,
666 - 669,162,’ sīc fātur et arma signaque et afflīctās omnī iam parte catervās circumit et revocat mātūra in fāta ruentīs sēque negat tantī,Positive,"So saying, he\then rode through the shattered ranks, all amongst\the troops, rallying them to the standards, halting\their flight to imminent death, saying he was not\worthy of their sacrifice",,,0
