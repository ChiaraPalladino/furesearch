## Preliminary transcription guidelines

* Unclear elements should be marked with the "unclear" tag. A question may be typed in the "question" attribute. 
* All abbreviations and symbols must be resolved using the Transkribus "abbr" tag.
* Citations will often contain abbreviated versions of authors names and work titles. These should be resolved as much as it is reasonable. Further research may reveal the correct way to resolve these citations.
* Words in a different language than Latin need to be marked with the "language" tag on Transkribus and the language needs to be specified in the "language" attribute. This will often be Ancient Greek. You may also use the Wikidata identifier Q35497 (click on Wikidata ID and type "Ancient Greek" in the search window).
