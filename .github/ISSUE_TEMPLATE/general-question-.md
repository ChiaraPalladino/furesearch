Before you post... 

**Have you read the project guidelines?**

When you post... 
* Describe the problem as clearly as possible
* Provide examples of where the problem occurs. Provide as much context as possible: indicate citation of the text where the examples are (e.g. Odyssey 9.234), or quote the full text. 
* If the question is urgent, tag or assign the issue to me. 
* Add the appropriate labels to the issue.
