# Text Alignment: Documentation

This folder contains the exported files and guidelines for the alignment of Greek and Latin texts. The alignments are created using Ugarit (https://ugarit.ialigner.com/) and following the Alignment Guidelines established by Palladino et al. (2024).

The structure of this folder is as follows: 
* Alignment Guidelines: the authoritative guidelines used to align Greek and English.
* odyssey-alignment: a folder containing the exported csv files from Ugarit, containing the completed alignments of Odyssey Book 9, and the csv table with all the aligned sentences.
