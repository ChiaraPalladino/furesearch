## Translation Alignment of Odyssey Book 9: Project Report

Curator: Maria Curley (curlma0@furman.edu)

#### Introduction
This summer, I participated in Classics research with Dr. Palladino. My task was to look at a 205-line segment from the _Odyssey_ Book 9 and analyze how this section was handled by six different translators. These were: George Chapman (1615), Alexander Pope (1725), Samuel Butler (1900), Robert Fitzgerald (1961), Stanley Lombardo (2000), and Emily Wilson (2017). To do this, I used a website called Ugarit (https://ugarit.ialigner.com/index.php), which displayed the original Greek text on the left side of the screen and a passage from each translation on the right side. Using Ugarit, I made pairs of each Greek word and its English equivalent for all the translations. The Greek sides and English sides each had their own percentage of words that corresponded with the other side. From this work, I was able to determine which of the translations were closest to the original Greek and think more broadly about what makes a “good” translation.

Throughout the following report, I use the words “accuracy” or “textual accuracy” in reference to the English translations of the Greek text. This refers mainly to how much of the Greek text is represented in English, represented by the percentages on Ugarit. Segments with portions of the text left out would overall be considered less “accurate”, as well as those with new text changed or added in. If a translator puts effort into conveying the meanings of the Greek words in their English version, this contributes to the accuracy of each segment of their work.


#### Paragraph 1
To look at each translation, I separated the 205-line passage into 12 segments of about 20 lines each. After my work of approximately eight weeks, I determined the translation that had the lowest percentages overall was Pope’s from 1725. The average of the Greek and English sides of lines 9.361-566 was 47.79%. The highest value in this data set was 63%, and the lowest was 34%. Pope’s translation is one of two that rearranged certain words so that the English translation was rhyming. This was most likely due to the fact that the _Odyssey_ was originally orally performed in Greek, so the translation was made in such a way that it could be delivered as a song or rhyming poem. Pope took liberties in his translation, adding and changing text to deliver the story in the way he wanted. Pope’s main focus in his adaptation seemed to be adding powerful imagery rather than aiming for complete textual accuracy. This can be seen in the final segment of lines 9.543-566, in which the sentiment and meaning of the Greek was kept largely the same, but several new or different phrases were added. ![pope1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0397cf4-4b88-4661-a525-39c410be7e65)


The purpose of these phrases were likely to enhance the readers’ experience, tell the story in Pope’s voice, and make it possible for the rhymes to make sense. Pope’s translation contains the largest deviations from the original Greek text, but it retells the events reliably.

#### Paragraph 2
Though many of the translations were close in overall percentage, the next lowest was Fitzgerald’s translation from 1961. This translation had an average of 51.08%, with a highest value of 63% and a lowest value of 36%. The majority of Fitzgerald's passages fall between 50-54%. This translation is separated into lines, without rhyming. This translation stood out to me, having slight differences in the proper names used. It was also the first of my selected translations to use the Greek names of figures instead of Roman ones. A screenshot from lines 9.500-521 helps to display the ways the names in Fitzgerald’s translation differ from previous translations. ![fitzgerald1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76689c6b-e1c8-4625-a7c3-0b2456f5ea1b)

Overall, Fitzgerald’s translation is an interesting and thoughtful rendition of Book 9 of the _Odyssey_.

#### Paragraph 3
Chapman’s and Butler’s translations both had the same percentage of words that corresponded in English and Greek at 52.63%. The highest percentage in this segment of Chapman’s work from 1615 is 63%, and the lowest percentage is 35%. Nine of the passages have a corresponding rate of between 60-65%. Chapman’s translation of these lines appears to be one of the longest of the six translations, with nearly all the small segments of lines being longer in English than in Greek. This likely contributed to the high percentages of words that remain in both languages. Chapman’s translation was the first one I looked at, and the language seems geared toward his 17th century audience. This made it difficult to understand at times. An example of this is the passage of 9.378-397, which seems to require a knowledge and understanding of how to man a ship.

The introduction to Pope’s translation, written by Theodore Alois Buckley, refers to Chapman’s work as “fine, bold, rough old English”. Like Pope’s translation, Chapman has words arranged in a certain way so as to allow for rhyming lines. Chapman’s translation was very good for its time, but is not as accessible to the modern reader.

#### Paragraph 4
Butler’s _Odyssey_ translation from 1900 had a highest percentage value of 62% and a lowest value of 40%. The majority of passages from this translation lie between 55-59%. This translation is unlike all the others because it was written in prose, with no line breaks or rhyming. It follows Chapman’s and Pope’s translations, and of these, it is the easiest to comprehend. It does not add many sentences or phrases that are not present in the Greek. It also made some segments more concise. The passage of 9.378-397 that was especially difficult in Chapman’s translation is made much simpler in Butler’s, though this comes at the cost of leaving some Greek words out. ![butler1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2efeedcd-be92-40fd-a648-2210d831ab4a)

Another example of this can be seen in a screenshot of lines 9.525-531, in which some words have equivalents in both languages, but a few phrases of the Greek text are not present in English. It also seems that the text at the end of the second paragraph in English was added in later. ![butler2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a254e3a-0352-49d2-a271-8c777a6b51f0)

For people who are wanting an older but more readable translation, Butler’s is a good selection.

#### Paragraph 5
Wilson’s translation from 2017 has an average rate of 55.75%. The highest value is 65%, and the lowest is 46%. Seven of the translations are between 60-65%, and another seven are from 55-59%. This is the most recently-published translation I have selected and was one of the easiest to align due to the modern text. It has the second-highest percentage of all texts, with the highest overall being Lombardo’s work. This suggests an overall trend of the recent translations being more accurate to the original Greek. Translators are taking fewer liberties and seem more committed than previous translators to tell the story as it was written. This can be seen in Wilson’s most accurate segment, 9.366-377, in which the majority of words in Greek have equivalents in English, and vice versa.

Wilson provides an excellent interpretation of this ancient work.

#### Paragraph 6
Lombardo’s translation, published in 2000, was the most textually accurate one, with an average value of 58.46%. The highest value is 67%, and the lowest one is 46%. Nine of these segments are between 60-65%, and ten of them are between 55-59%. Lombardo has a unique linguistic style in his translation, which at times involves a more informal tone. A few examples of this are highlighted in the screenshot of 9.500-521. ![lombardo1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8167eb7c-9ddd-46dd-a171-664a1c5f4227)

This specific style may not appeal to everyone, including myself upon first reading. However, after my analysis on Ugarit, I have amended my opinion. This website allows me to remove any bias and look objectively at if a translation has succeeded in what it set out to do. The English and Greek in the screenshot are 65% and 64% respectively, which are some of the best numbers of any translation. Though the tone may not be everyone’s preference, it is difficult to argue that Lombardo had a “bad” translation. He does a great job of carrying over the words and meanings from Greek into English.

#### Conclusion
After all my research, I have determined that Wilson’s and Lombardo’s translations were the most accurate. They contain the highest percentage of words that were present in the Greek version, marking a shift toward textual accuracy with newer translations. Using this metric, Wilson’s and Lombardo’s translations could be considered the best. However, it is important to remember that there are multiple factors that go into making a “good” translation. This is something I considered a lot as I looked at Lombardo’s and Pope’s translations in particular. Although Pope’s _Odyssey_ has the lowest percentages, it is by no means a sloppy or lazy work. He made very intentional choices based on what he wanted to emphasize or the story details he wanted to include, as did every translator. These include choices about the names used, how to interpret certain words, and how to convey plot events or emotions of characters. Similarly, whether or not Lombardo, whose percentage was the highest, had the best translation is subjective. Different translations will resonate differently with different people based on what they are looking for in a translation. All of the translators put considerable effort into their work, and it is clear to see when one studies these 205 lines. Still, it was fascinating to see which translators were most accurate with their work and analyze what they were able to make when they all started with the same Greek text. While working on this project, I was able to get more experience with classical Greek, which I appreciated. I was able to learn a lot about what translators choose to prioritize during their work and how this changed over time. I enjoyed this process and I look forward to being able to share it at Furman Engaged.
