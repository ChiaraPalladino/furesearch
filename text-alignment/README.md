# Text Alignment 

Project Curator: Maria Curley 

This folder will contain the exported files and guidelines for the alignment of Greek and Latin texts. 

The structure of this folder is as follows: 
* Alignment Guidelines: the authoritative guidelines used to align Greek and English.
* odyssey-alignment: a folder containing the exported csv files from Ugarit, containing the completed alignments. The text has been divided into chunks of 15 lines each. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ib7qA1fwPr61znWTKTSxAcOKqZg2bLst-JdhvCmpCSo/edit?usp=sharing
* The text of the Odyssey in txt format, to be imported into Ugarit. 

## Text of the Odyssey 
* The whole text of the _Odyssey_, in Greek, is on Scaife: https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:9. A parallel translation can be selected for further help, and clicking on words will generate morphology and lemmas, with basic translations.
* Another useful resource is Logeion, to look up specific words: https://logeion.uchicago.edu/
