# Specific Notable Edge-Case Annotations 
Including a list of all person.ethnic identifiers, as well as some other niche, grey-area exceptions. If they are posted here, they've been dealt with to a functional extent (ie. the best of my ability).


## Book 2 - Annotations to check: 
 * 2.1.3 "the ruler of Teuthrania" and "the
Laconian" > epithet    
      Explanation (CP):   ὁ Τευθρανίας is an article nom. sg. + placename at the genitive. βασιλεύς (ruler) is implied in this case. So, "king of Teuthrania" is a correct translation. I have indicated this in the comment to the annotation.

* 2.1.5 "the Laconian" and "the Thessalian"
* 2.1.7 "Greek"
* 2.1.10 "the Arcadian" and "the Theban"
* 2.1.11 "Theopompus, an Athenian"
* 2.1.16 "Greek"
* 2.2.7 "the Thracian"
* 2.2.8 "Greek"
> This accidentally got deleted off the document comments, but this refers to "the Greek officers" and Dr. Palladino asked we knew of them: It seems that in this usage, officers is a catch-all term for at least the generals and possibly the captains as well. The Greek generals at this point in the book---who are actually mentioned in this book---are: Proxenus the Boeotian, Sophaentus the Stymphalian, Socrates of Achaea, Clearchus, Cheirisophus, and Menon of Thessaly (at this point he hasn't betrayed the Ten Thousand yet and is still Greek), and all of these are known from Book 1 too, where who they command are listed out. Sosis the Syracusan is also said to command 300 hoplites, but he's only mentioned once in the whole text and never brought up again, so it's unclear if he died, deserted, or what. Also, these are not counting Pythagoras of Sparta and Tamos the Egyptian, who commanded trireme fleets (thus probably wouldn't be on land with everybody?), but it's also not clear where they are. Finally, it's unclear if this is a list of all the generals, and this doesn't count the hundreds of different captains who might be considered 'officers,' of whom only a few (like Xanthicles) are named. So, that's all to say, you floated the idea of maybe annotating this differently, but that's all the information I could find, so I defer to you. Right now, I'll keep it as collective.ethnic
* 2.2.20 "the Elean"
* 2.3.18 "Men of Greece" (check Greek on this, it might be necessary to annotate whole string if it's all one word in Greek)
> The Greek uses "ἄνδρες Ἕλληνες" so the translation "Men of Greece" doesn't as clearly capture that it's an adjective ethnic identifier in the original text. Given that "Greek men" is just as reasonable a translation, but "Men" isn't necessary to clarify the "Greek" at all, I annotated just "Greece" as collective.ethnic
* 2.4.13 "Sittace"
> In reviewing how exactly I tag cities Xenophon mentioned (whether to distinguish between city_large vs city vs city_small, etc.) I looked at the Greek which just uses polis and then some adjectives, but no special word for city (πόλις ἦν μεγάλη καὶ πολυάνθρωπος), so given that 'large' and 'populous' are not inherent in the word choice, I will just use a 'city' tag here and for future instances, and the only other one that will be distinguished is 'city_abandoned'
* 2.4.15 "Menon's friend"
> Not clearly resolved yet; the Greek for this sentence is "Μένωνα δὲ οὐκ ἐζήτει, καὶ ταῦτα παρʼ Ἀριαίου ὢν τοῦ Μένωνος ξένου," so both Menon and Ariaeus are mentioned as proper nouns in the phrase, so my guess would be to keep them annotated/tagged as separate individuals?
* 2.4.26 "the Persian"
> From meeting notes: _"The Persian" in 2.4.26 annotate it as if it said something like "Tissaphernes \[\...\] the Persian" but referred to "the Persian" in isolation later, so annotate "the Persian" as a place in recogito, then tag it person.ethnic So essentially we're treating it as if it said "Tissaphernes the Persian" all connected I was also going to put in the Tissaphernes' authoritative name tag for this instance so that we know
> I actually misremembered part of this instance: It's not Tissaphernes, but Cyrus and Artaxerxes' unnamed half-brother. In this case, should I give it any other identifying tag beyond just person.ethnic?
* 2.5.31-33 list of generals
*  2.5.37 more captains
* 2.6.16 "the Boeotian" and "of Leontini"
* 2.6.21 "the Thessalian" 2.6.30 "the Arcadian" and "the Achaean"

## Book 3 - Annotations to check: 
* 3.1.4 "the Athenian"
* 3.1.5 "..., the Athenian"
* 3.1.5 "Athenian government"
> Correct to annotate it as collective.organization, just don't nest another place annotation of 'Athenian' inside it ]
* 3.1.26 "who spoke in the Boeotian dialect"
> mostly one word in Greek (βοιωτιάζων), and obviously meant to identify him, though a slightly odd way of doing it Right now, we'll annotate "Boeotian" as a language \[need to review if we'll do language.ethnic?\] because saying "..who spoke Boeotian" would also make sense, and we'd know it'd be a language
* 3.1.31 "the Stymphalian"
* 3.1.34 "the Elean"
* 3.1.45 "\...heard that you were an Athenian"
> This one is a weird instance since it's a quote and thus 'you' and 'Athenian' are both in accusative and 2nd person, so I cannot tell if it would be considered an epithet or not for certain. I went ahead and, while 'Xenophon' is in the vocative and 'Athenian' is accusative, Athenian is obviously in reference to Xenophon, so I annotated it as if it was "Xenophon the Athenian"
* 3.1.47 list of generals again
* 3.2.1 "the Lacedaemonian"
* 3.2.4 "the Orchomenian"
* 3.2.37 "since he is a Lacedaemonian" \[almost certainly collective.ethnic\]
> I made it person.ethnic because in the Greek both Cheirisophus and Lacedaemonian are nominative singular masculine, so even though they're divided by a couple words I think it should be the same as an epithet (ie. Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian)
* 3.3.2 "'Men of Greece'" should maybe be the whole string \[same reasoning as Book 2\]
> The Greek uses "ἄνδρες Ἕλληνες" so the translation "Men of Greece" doesn't as clearly capture that it's an adjective ethnic identifier in the original text. Given that "Greek men" is just as reasonable a translation, I annotated it as collective.ethnic
* 3.3.5 "the Arcadian"
* 3.3.20 "Lycius, the son of Polystartus" another weird nesting instance (like with Glus) and "an Athenian" immediately after, since it's an identifier
* 3.4.47 "the Sicyonian"
* 3.5.5 "men of Greece" conundrum once more
> See previous instances
