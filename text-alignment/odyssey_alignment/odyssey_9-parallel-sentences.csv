361-365,"τρὶς μὲν ἔδωκα φέρων , τρὶς δʼ ἔκπιεν ἀφραδίῃσιν .
αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ Κύκλωπα περὶ φρένας ἤλυθεν οἶνος ,
καὶ τότε δή μιν ἔπεσσι προσηύδων μειλιχίοισι ·
Κύκλωψ , εἰρωτᾷς μʼ ὄνομα κλυτόν , αὐτὰρ ἐγώ τοι
ἐξερέω · σὺ δέ μοι δὸς ξείνιον , ὥς περ ὑπέστης .","This again
I gave him , and again ; nor could the fool abstain ,
But drunk as often . When the noble juice
Had wrought upon his spirit , I then gave use
To fairer language , saying : ‘Cyclop ! now ,
As thou demand’st , I’ll tell my name , do thou
Make good thy hospitable gift to me .","Thrice drained , and poured the deluge on his soul .
His sense lay covered with the dozy fume ;
While thus my fraudful speech I reassume .
‘Thy promised boon , O Cyclop ! now I claim ,
And plead my title ;","three times did I fill the bowl for him , and three times did he drain it without thought or heed ; then , when I saw that the wine had got into his head , I said to him as plausibly as I could : ' Cyclops , you ask my name and I will tell it you ; give me , therefore , the present you promised me ;
","Three bowls I brought him , and he poured them down .
I saw the fuddle and flush come over him ,
then I sang out in cordial tones : "" Kyklops ,
you ask my honorable name ? Remember
the gift you promised me , and I shall tell you .","Three times the fool drained the bowl dry ,
And when the wine had begun to work on his mind ,
I spoke these sweet words to him : ' Cyclops ,
You ask me my name , my glorious name ,
And I will tell it to you . Remember now ,
To give me the gift just as you promised .","So I gave him
another cup of wine , and then two more .
He drank them all , unwisely . With the wine
gone to his head , I told him , all politeness ,
‘Cyclops , you asked my name . I will reveal it ;
then you must give the gift you promised me ,
of hospitality ."
366-377,"Οὖτις ἐμοί γʼ ὄνομα · Οὖτιν δέ με κικλήσκουσι

ὣς ἐφάμην , ὁ δέ μʼ αὐτίκʼ ἀμείβετο νηλέι θυμῷ ·
Οὖτιν ἐγὼ πύματον ἔδομαι μετὰ οἷς ἑτάροισιν ,
τοὺς δʼ ἄλλους πρόσθεν · τὸ δέ τοι ξεινήιον ἔσται .

καὶ τότʼ ἐγὼ τὸν μοχλὸν ὑπὸ σποδοῦ ἤλασα πολλῆς ,

θάρσυνον , μή τίς μοι ὑποδείσας ἀναδύη .","My name is No-Man ; No-Man each degree
Of friends , as well as parents , call my name . ’
He answer’d , as his cruel soul became :
‘No-Man ! I’ll eat thee last of all thy friends ;
And this is that in which so much amends
I vow’d to thy deservings , thus shall be
My hospitable gift made good to thee . ’
This said , he upwards fell , but then bent round
His fleshy neck ; and Sleep , with all crowns crown’d ,
Subdued the savage . From his throat brake out
My wine , with man’s-flesh gobbets , like a spout ,
When , loaded with his cups , he lay and snor’d ;
And then took I the club’s end up , and gor’d
The burning coal-heap , that the point might heat ;
Confirm’d my fellow’s minds , lest Fear should let
Their vow’d assay , and make them fly my aid .","Noman is my name .
By that distinguish’d from my tender years ,
’Tis what my parents call me , and my peers .

"" The giant then : ‘Our promis’d grace receive ,
The hospitable boon we mean to give :
When all thy wretched crew have felt my power ,
Noman shall be the last I will devour . ’

"" He said : then nodding with the fumes of wine
Droop’d his huge head , and snoring lay supine .
His neck obliquely o’er his shoulders hung ,
Press’d with the weight of sleep that tames the strong :
There belch’d the mingled streams of wine and blood ,
And human flesh , his indigested food .
Sudden I stir the embers , and inspire
With animating breath the seeds of fire :
Each drooping spirit with bold words repair ,
And urged my train the dreadful deed to dare .","my name is Noman ; this is what my father and mother and my friends have always called me . '

"" But the cruel wretch said , ' Then I will eat all Noman ' s comrades before Noman himself , and will keep Noman for the last . This is the present that I will make him . '

As he spoke he reeled , and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground . His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him . Presently he turned sick , and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging , for he was very drunk . Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it , and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted .","My name is Nohbdy : mother , father , and friends ,
everyone calls me Nohbdy . ' And he said :
' Nohbdy ' s my meat , then , after I eat his friends .
Others come first . There ' s a noble gift , now . '
Even as he spoke , he reeled and tumbled backward ,
his great head lolling to one side ; and sleep
took him like any creature . Drunk , hiccuping ,
he dribbled streams of liquor and bits of men .
Now , by the gods , I drove my big hand spike
deep in the embers , charring it again ,
and cheered my men along with battle talk
to keep their courage up : no quitting now .","Noman is my name . They call me Noman—
My mother , my father , and all my friends , too . ’
He answered me from his pitiless heart :
‘Noman I will eat last after his friends .
Friends first , him last . That’s my gift to you . ’
He listed as he spoke and then fell flat on his back ,
His thick neck bent sideways . He was sound asleep ,
Belching out wine and bits of human flesh
In his drunken stupor . I swung into action ,
Thrusting the stake deep in the embers ,
Heating it up , and all the while talking to my men
To keep up their morale .","My name is Noman .
My family and friends all call me Noman . ’
He answered with no pity in his heart ,
‘I will eat Noman last ; first I will eat
the other men . That is my gift to you . ’
Then he collapsed , fell on his back , and lay there ,
his massive neck askew . All-conquering sleep
took him . In drunken heaviness , he spewed
wine from his throat , and chunks of human flesh .
And then I drove the spear into the embers
to heat it up , and told my men , ‘Be brave ! ’
I wanted none of them to shrink in fear ."

Amidst the huge fire to get hard’ning , hot ,
And glow’d extremely , though ’twas green ; which got
From forth the cinders , close about me stood
My hardy friends ; but that which did the good
Was God’s good inspiratión , that gave
A spirit beyond the spirit they us’d to have ;
Who took the olive spar , made keen before ,
And plung’d it in his eye , and up I bore ,
Bent to the top close , and help’d pour it in ,
With all my forces . And as you have seen
A ship-wright bore a naval beam , he oft
Thrusts at the auger’s froofe , works still aloft ,
And at the shank help others , with a cord
Wound round about to make it sooner bor’d ,
All plying the round still ; so into his eye
The fiery stake we labour’d to imply .
Out gush’d the blood that scalded , his eye-ball
Thrust out a flaming vapour , that scorch’d all
His brows and eye-lids , his eye-strings did crack ,
As in the sharp and burning rafter brake .
And as a smith , to harden any tool ,
Broad axe , or mattock , in his trough doth cool
The red-hot substance , that so fervent is
It makes the cold wave straight to seethe and hiss ;
So sod and hiss’d his eye about the stake .
He roar’d withal , and all his cavern brake
In claps like thunder . We did frighted fly ,
Dispers’d in corners . He from forth his eye
The fixed stake pluck’d ; after which the blood
Flow’d freshly forth ; and , mad ,","The stake now glow’d beneath the burning bed
( Green as it was ) and sparkled fiery red ,
Then forth the vengeful instrument I bring ;
With beating hearts my fellows form a ring .
Urged my some present god , they swift let fall
The pointed torment on his visual ball .
Myself above them from a rising ground
Guide the sharp stake , and twirl it round and round .
As when a shipwright stands his workmen o’er ,
Who ply the wimble , some huge beam to bore ;
Urged on all hands , it nimbly spins about ,
The grain deep-piercing till it scoops it out :
In his broad eye he whirls the fiery wood ;
From the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood ;
Singed are his brows ; the scorching lids grow black ;
The jelly bubbles , and the fibres crack .
And as when armourers temper in the ford
The keen-edged pole-axe , or the shining sword ,
The red-hot metal hisses in the lake ,
Thus in his eye-ball hiss’d the plunging stake .
He sends a dreadful groan , the rocks around
Through all their inmost winding caves resound .
Scared we recoiled . Forth with frantic hand ,
He tore","When the wood , green though it was , was about to blaze , I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat , and my men gathered round me , for heaven had filled their hearts with courage . We drove the sharp end of the beam into the monster ' s eye , and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship ' s plank with an auger , which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose . Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye , till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round , so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows , and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire . As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives strength to the iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so , even thus did the Cyclops ' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood , and his hideous yells made the cave ring again . We ran away in a fright , but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye ,","The pike of olive , green though it had been ,
reddened and glowed as if about to catch .
I drew it from the coals and my four fellows
gave me a hand , lugging it near the Kyklops
as more than natural force nerved them ; straight
forward they sprinted , lifted it , and rammed it
deep in his crater eye , and I leaned on it
turning it as a shipwright turns a drill
in planking , having men below to swing
the two-handled strap that spins it in the groove .
So with our brand we bored that great eye socket
while blood ran out around the red hot bar .
Eyelid and lash were seared ; the pierced ball
hissed broiling , and the roots popped . In a smithy
one sees a white-hot axehead or an adze
plunged and wrung in a cold tub , screeching steam—
the way they make soft iron hale and hard— :
just so that eyeball hissed around the spike .
The Kyklops bellowed and the rock roared round him ,
and we fell back in fear . Clawing his face
he tugged the bloody spike out of his eye ,","When the olivewood stake
Was about to catch fire , green though it was ,
And was really glowing , I took it out
And brought it right up to him . My men
Stood around me , and some god inspired us .
My men lifted up the olivewood stake
And drove the sharp point right into his eye ,
While I , putting my weight behind it , spun it around
The way a man bores a ship’s beam with a drill ,
Leaning down on it while other men beneath him
Keep it spinning and spinning with a leather strap .
That’s how we twirled the fiery-pointed stake
In the Cyclops’ eye . The blood formed a whirlpool
Around its searing tip . His lids and brow
Were all singed by the heat from the burning eyeball
And its roots crackled in the fire and hissed
Like an axe-head or adze a smith dips into water
When he wants to temper the iron—that’s how his eye
Sizzled and hissed around the olivewood stake .
He screamed , and the rock walls rang with his voice .
We shrank back in terror while he wrenched
The blood-grimed stake from his eye","The fire soon seized the olive spear ,
green though it was , and terribly it glowed .
I quickly snatched it from the fire . My crew
stood firm : some god was breathing courage in us .
They took the olive spear , its tip all sharp ,
and shoved it in his eye . I leaned on top
and twisted it , as when a man drills wood
for shipbuilding . Below , the workers spin
the drill with straps , stretched out from either end .
So round and round it goes , and so we whirled
the fire-sharp weapon in his eye . His blood
poured out around the stake , and blazing fire
sizzled his lids and brows , and fried the roots .
As when a blacksmith dips an axe or adze
to temper it in ice-cold water ; loudly
it shrieks . From this , the iron takes on its power .
So did his eyeball crackle on the spear .
Horribly then he howled , the rocks resounded ,
and we shrank back in fear . He tugged the spear
out of his eye , all soaked with gushing blood ."

About his hovel . Out he then did cry
For other Cyclops , that in caverns by
Upon a windy promontory dwell’d ;
Who , hearing how impetuously he yell’d ,
Rush’d ev’ry way about him , and inquir’d ,
What ill afflicted him , that he exspir’d
Such horrid clamours , and in sacred Night
To break their sleeps so ? Ask’d him , if his fright
Came from some mortal that his flocks had driv’n ?
Or if by craft , or might , his death were giv’n ?
He answer’d from his den : ‘By craft , nor might ,
No-Man hath giv’n me death . ’ They then said right ,
‘If no man hurt thee , and thyself alone ,
That which is done to thee by Jove is done ;
And what great Jove inflicts no man can fly .
Pray to thy Father yet , a Deity ,
And prove , from him if thou canst help acquire . ’
Thus spake they , leaving him ; when all-on-fire
My heart with joy was , that so well my wit
And name deceiv’d him ; whom now pain did split ,
And groaning up and down he groping tried
To find the stone , which found , he put aside ;
But in the door sat , feeling if he could
( As his sheep issued ) on some man lay hold ;
Esteeming me a fool , that could devise
No stratagem to ‘scape his gross surprise .","and dash’d on earth and gory brand ;
Then calls the Cyclops , all that round him dwell ,
With voice like thunder , and a direful yell .
From all their dens the one-eyed race repair ,
From rifted rocks , and mountains bleak in air .
All haste assembled , at his well-known roar ,
Inquire the cause , and crowd the cavern door .

"" ‘What hurts thee , Polypheme ? what strange affright
Thus breaks our slumbers , and disturbs the night ?
Does any mortal , in the unguarded hour
Of sleep , oppress thee , or by fraud or power ?
Or thieves insidious thy fair flock surprise ? ’
Thus they ; the Cyclop from his den replies :

"" ‘Friends , Noman kills me ; Noman in the hour
Of sleep , oppresses me with fraudful power . ’
‘If no man hurt thee , but the hand divine
Inflict disease , it fits thee to resign :
To Jove or to thy father Neptune pray . ’
The brethren cried , and instant strode away .
"" Joy touch’d my secret soul and conscious heart ,
Pleased with the effect of conduct and of art .
Meantime the Cyclop , raging with his wound ,
Spreads his wide arms , and searches round and round :
At last , the stone removing from the gate ,
With hands extended in the midst he sate ;
And search’d each passing sheep , and felt it o’er ,
Secure to seize us ere we reach’d the door
( Such as his shallow wit he deem’d was mine ) ;","and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain , shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him ; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying , and asked what was the matter with him .

"" ' What ails you , Polyphemus , ' said they , ' that you make such a noise , breaking the stillness of the night , and preventing us from being able to sleep ? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep ? Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force ?

"" But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave , ' Noman is killing me by fraud ! Noman is killing me by force ! '

"" ' Then , ' said they , ' if no man is attacking you , you must be ill ; when Jove makes people ill , there is no help for it , and you had better pray to your father Neptune . '

"" Then they went away , and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever stratagem , but the Cyclops , groaning and in an agony of pain , felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door ; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with the sheep , for he thought I might be foolish enough to attempt this .","threw it away , and his wild hands went groping ;
then he set up a howl for Kyklopes
who lived in caves on windy peaks nearby .
Some heard him ; and they came by divers ways
to clump around outside and call : ' What ails you ,
Polyphemos ? Why do you cry so sore
in the starry night ? You will not let us sleep .
Sure no man ' s driving off your flock ? No man
has tricked you , ruined you ? ' Out of the cave
the mammoth Polyphemos roared in answer :
' Nohbdy , Nohbdy ' s tricked me , Nohbdy ' s ruined me ! '
To this rough shout they made a sage reply :
' Ah well , if nobody has played you foul
there in your lonely bed , we are no use in pain
given by great Zeus . Let it be your father ,
Poseidon Lord , to whom you pray . ' So saying
they trailed away . And I was filled with laughter
to see how like a charm the name deceived them .
Now Kyklops , wheezing as the pain came on him ,
fumbled to wrench away the great doorstone
and squatted in the breach with arms thrown wide
for any silly beast or man who bolted—
hoping somehow I might be such a fool .","and flung it
Away from him , blundering about and shouting
To the other Cyclopes , who lived around him
In caverns among the windswept crags .
They heard his cry and gathered from all sides
Around his cave and asked him what ailed him :
‘Polyphemus , why are you hollering so much
And keeping us up the whole blessed night ?
Is some man stealing your flocks from you ,
Or killing you , maybe , by some kind of trick ? ’
And Polyphemus shouted out to them :
‘Noman is killing me by some kind of trick ! ’
They sent their words winging back to him :
‘If no man is hurting you , then your sickness
Comes from Zeus and can’t be helped .
You should pray to your father , Lord Poseidon . ’
They left then , and I laughed in my heart
At how my phony name had fooled them so well .
Cyclops meanwhile was groaning in agony .
Groping around , he removed the doorstone
And sat in the entrance with his hands spread out
To catch anyone who went out with the sheep—
As if I could be so stupid .","Desperately with both hands he hurled it from him ,
and shouted to the Cyclopes who lived
in caves high up on windy cliffs around .
They heard and came from every side , and stood
near to the cave , and called out , ‘Polyphemus !
What is the matter ? Are you badly hurt ?
Why are you screaming through the holy night
and keeping us awake ? Is someone stealing
your herds , or trying to kill you , by some trick
or force ? ’ Strong Polyphemus from inside
replied , ‘My friends ! Noman is killing me
by tricks , not force . ’ Their words flew back to him :
‘If no one hurts you , you are all alone :
Great Zeus has made you sick ; no help for that .
Pray to your father , mighty Lord Poseidon . ’
Then off they went , and I laughed to myself ,
at how my name , the ‘no man’ maneuver , tricked him .
The Cyclops groaned and labored in his pain ,
felt with blind hands and took the door-stone out ,
and sat there at the entrance , arms outstretched ,
to catch whoever went out with the sheep .
Maybe he thought I was a total fool ."

My friends and me from death so eminent
To get deliver’d , all my wiles I wove

Fat fleecy rams , most fair , and great , lay there ,
That did a burden like a violet bear .
These , while this learn’d-in-villainy did sleep ,
I yok’d with osiers cut there , sheep to sheep ,
Three in a rank , and still the mid sheep bore
A man about his belly , the two more

Choosing myself the fairest of the den ,
His fleecy belly under-crept , embrac’d
His back , and in his rich wool wrapt me fast

Well fed , and largest of the fleecy care ,
These , three and three , with osier bands we tied

The midmost bore a man , the outward two
Secured each side : so bound we all the crew ,
One ram remain’d , the leader of the flock :
In his deep fleece my grasping hands I lock ,
And fast beneath , in wooly curls inwove ,
There cling implicit , and confide in Jove .",""" As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own life and those of my companions ; I schemed and schemed , as one who knows that his life depends upon it , for the danger was very great . In the end I deemed that this plan would be the best . The male sheep were well grown , and carried a heavy black fleece , so I bound them noiselessly in threes together , with some of the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep . There was to be a man under the middle sheep , and the two on either side were to cover him , so that there were three sheep to each man . As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others , so I caught hold of him by the back , esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly , and flung on patiently to his fleece , face upwards , keeping a firm hold on it all the time .

"" Thus , then , did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came ,","But I kept thinking how to win the game :
death sat there huge ; how could we slip away ?
I drew on all my wits , and ran through tactics ,
reasoning as a man will for dear life ,
until a trick came—and it pleased me well .
The Kyklops ' rams were handsome , fat , with heavy
fleeces , a dark violet . Three abreast
I tied them silently together , twining
cords of willow from the ogre ' s bed ;
then slung a man under each middle one
to ride there safely , shielded left and right .
So three sheep could convey each man . I took
the woolliest ram , the choicest of the flock ,
and hung myself under his kinky belly ,
pulled up tight , with fingers twisted deep
in sheepskin ringlets for an iron grip .
So , breathing hard , we waited until morning .","I thought it over ,
Trying to come up with the best plan I could
To get us all out from the jaws of death .
I wove all sorts of wiles , as a man will
When his life is on the line . My best idea
Had to do with the sheep that were there , big ,
Thick-fleeced beauties with wool dark as violets .
Working silently , I bound them together
With willow branches the Cyclops slept on .
I bound them in threes . Each middle sheep
Carried a man underneath , protected by
The two on either side : three sheep to a man .
As for me , there was a ram , the best in the flock .
I grabbed his back and curled up beneath
His shaggy belly . There I lay , hands twined
Into the marvelous wool , hanging on for dear life .
And so , muffling our groans , we waited for dawn .","But I was strategizing , hatching plans ,
so that my men and I could all survive .
I wove all kinds of wiles and cunning schemes ;
danger was near and it was life or death .
The best idea I formed was this : there were
those well-fed sturdy rams with good thick fleece ,
wool as dark as violets — all fine big creatures .
So silently I tied them with the rope
used by the giant Cyclops as a bed .
I bound the rams in sets of three and set
a man beneath each middle sheep , with one
on either side , and so my men were saved .
One ram was best of all the flock ; I grabbed
his back and curled myself up underneath
his furry belly , clinging to his fleece ;
by force of will I kept on hanging there .
And then we waited miserably for day ."

was weak and worn with pain , he felt the back
of each ram as he lined them up — but missed
the men tied up beneath their woolly bellies ."

First to the field and river’s bank to lead ,
And first with stately step at evening hour
Thy fleecy fellows usher to their bower .

Thou movest , as conscious of thy master’s woe !
Seest thou these lids that now unfold in vain ?

And would but Fate the power of speech afford .
Soon might’st thou tell me , where in secret here
The dastard lurks , all trembling with his fear :
Swung round and round , and dash’d from rock to rock ,
His battered brains should on the pavement smoke
No ease , no pleasure my sad heart receives ,
While such a monster as vile Noman lives . ’

"" The giant spoke , and through the hollow rock
Dismiss’d the ram , the father of the flock .
No sooner freed , and through the inclosure pass’d ,
First I release myself , my fellows last :","As the ram was going out , last of all , heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self ; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said :

"" ' My good ram , what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this morning ? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you , but lead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain , and are the first to come home again at night ; but now you lag last of all . Is it because you know your master has lost his eye , and are sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down in his drink and blinded him ? But I will have his life yet .

"" As spoke he drove the ram outside , but when we were a little way out from the cave and yards , I first got from under the ram ' s belly , and then freed my comrades ;","Last of them all my ram , the leader , came ,
weighted by wool and me with my meditations .

' Sweet cousin ram , why lag behind the rest
in the night cave ? You never linger so ,
but graze before them all , and go afar
to crop sweet grass , and take your stately way
leading along the streams , until at evening
you run to be the first one in the fold .
Why , now , so far behind ? Can you be grieving
over your Master ' s eye ? That carrion rogue
and his accurst companions burnt it out
when he had conquered all my wits with wine .
Nohbdy will not get out alive , I swear .
Oh , had you brain and voice to tell
where he may be now , dodging all my fury !
Bashed by this hand and bashed on this rock wall
his brains would strew the floor , and I should have
rest from the outrage Nohbdy worked upon me . '
He sent us into the open , then . Close by ,
I dropped and rolled clear of the ram ' s belly ,
going this way and that to untie the men .","The great ram headed for the entrance last ,
Heavy with wool—and with me thinking hard .
Running his hands over the ram , Polyphemus said :
‘My poor ram , why are you leaving the cave
Last of all ? You’ve never lagged behind before .
You were always the first to reach the soft grass
With your big steps , first to reach the river ,
First to want to go back to the yard
At evening . Now you’re last of all . Are you sad
About your master’s eye ? A bad man blinded me ,
Him and his nasty friends , getting me drunk ,
Noman—but he’s not out of trouble yet !

You could tell me where he’s hiding . I would
Smash him to bits and spatter his brains
All over the cave . Then I would find some relief
From the pain this no-good Noman has caused me . '

When we had gone a little way from the cave ,
I first untangled myself from the ram
And then untied my men .","Last of them all , the big ram went outside ,
heavy with wool and me — the clever trickster .

‘Sweet ram , why are you last today to leave
the cave ? You are not normally so slow .
You are the first to eat the tender flowers ,
leaping across the meadow , first to drink ,
and first to want to go back to the sheepfold
at evening time . But now you are the last .
You grieve for Master’s eye ; that wicked man ,
helped by his nasty henchmen , got me drunk
and blinded me . Noman will not escape !

where he is skulking in his fear of me .
Then I would dash his brains out on the rocks ,
and make them spatter all across the cave ,
to ease the pain that no-good Noman brought . ’

They brake in tears ; which with a look I stay’d ,
And bade them take our boot in . They obey’d ,
And up we all went , sat , and us’d our oars .
But having left as far the savage shores
As one might hear a voice , we then might see
The Cyclop at the haven ; when instantly
I stay’d our oars , and this insultance us’d :
῾Cyclop ! thou shouldst not have so much abus’d

Against a man immartial , and a guest ,
And eat his fellows . Thou mightst know there were

And all the Gods , by me .","Fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before ,
And reach our vessel on the winding shore .
With joy the sailors view their friends return’d ,
And hail us living whom as dead they mourn’d
Big tears of transport stand in every eye :
I check their fondness , and command to fly .
Aboard in haste they heave the wealthy sheep ,
And snatch their oars , and rush into the deep .

"" Now off at sea , and from the shallows clear ,
As far as human voice could reach the ear ,
With taunts the distant giant I accost :
‘Hear me , O Cyclop ! hear , ungracious host !
’Twas on no coward , no ignoble slave ,
Thou meditatest thy meal in yonder cave ;
But one , the vengeance fated from above
Doom’d to inflict ; the instrument of Jove .
Thy barbarous breach of hospitable bands ,
The god , the god revenges by my hands . ’","as for the sheep , which were very fat , by constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship . The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death , but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed . However , I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to hush their crying , and told them to get all the sheep on board at once and put out to sea ; so they went aboard , took their places , and smote the grey sea with their oars . Then , when I had got as far out as my voice would reach , I began to jeer at the Cyclops .

"" ' Cyclops , ' said I , ' you should have taken better measure of your man before eating up his comrades in your cave . You wretch , eat up your visitors in your own house ? You might have known that your sin would find you out , and now Jove and the other gods have punished you . '","With many glances back , we rounded up
his fat , stiff-legged sheep to take aboard ,
and drove them down to where the good ship lay .
We saw , as we came near , our fellows ' faces
shining ; then we saw them turn to grief
tallying those who had not fled from death .
I hushed them , jerking head and eyebrows up ,
and in a low voice told them : ' Load this herd ;
move fast , and put the ship ' s head toward the breakers . '
They all pitched in at loading , then embarked
and struck their oars into the sea . Far out ,
as far off shore as shouted words would carry ,
I sent a few back to the adversary :
' O Kyklops ! Would you feast on my companions ?
Puny , am I , in a Caveman ' s hands ?
How do you like the beating that we gave you ,
you damned cannibal ? Eater of guests
under your roof ! Zeus and the gods have paid you ! '","Then , moving quickly ,
We drove those fat , long-shanked sheep
Down to the ship , keeping an eye on our rear .
We were a welcome sight to the rest of the crew ,
But when they started to mourn the men we had lost
I forbade it with an upward nod of my head ,
Signaling each man like that and ordering them
To get those fleecy sheep aboard instead ,
On the double , and get the ship out to sea .
Before you knew it they were on their benches
Beating the sea to white froth with their oars .
When we were offshore but still within earshot ,
I called out to the Cyclops , just to rub it in :
‘So , Cyclops , it turns out it wasn’t a coward
Whose men you murdered and ate in your cave ,
You savage ! But you got yours in the end ,
Didn’t you ? You had the gall to eat the guests
In your own house , and Zeus made you pay for it . ’","We stole his nice fat animals , and ran ,
constantly glancing all around and back
until we reached the ship . The other men
were glad to see us , their surviving friends ,
but wept for those who died . I ordered them
to stop their crying , scowling hard at each .
I made them shove the fleecy flock on board ,
and row the boat out into salty water .
So they embarked , sat on their rowing benches ,
and struck their oar blades in the whitening sea .
When I had gone as far as shouts can carry ,
I jeered back , ‘Hey , you , Cyclops ! Idiot !
The crew trapped in your cave did not belong
to some poor weakling . Well , you had it coming !
You had no shame at eating your own guests !
So Zeus and other gods have paid you back . ’"

His burning fury ; when the top he tore
From off a huge rock , and so right a throw

( Then first , twice further ) my heart was so great ,
It would again provoke him , but my men
On all sides rush’d about me , to contain ,
And said : ‘Unhappy ! why will you provoke

Giv’n with his rock-dart , made the sea thrust back
Our ship so far , and near hand forc’d our wrack ?
Should he again but hear your voice resound ,
And any word reach , thereby would be found
His dart’s direction , which would , in his fall ,
Crush piece-meal us , quite split our ship and all ;
So much dart wields the monster . ’",""" These words the Cyclop’s burning rage provoke ;
From the tall hill he rends a pointed rock ;
High o’er the billows flew the massy load ,
And near the ship came thundering on the flood .
It almost brush’d the helm , and fell before :
The whole sea shook , and refluent beat the shore ,
The strong concussion on the heaving tide
Roll’d back the vessel to the island’s side :
Again I shoved her off : our fate to fly ,
Each nerve we stretch , and every oar we ply .
Just ’scaped impending death , when now again
We twice as far had furrow’d back the main ,
Once more I raise my voice ; my friends , afraid ,
With mild entreaties my design dissuade :
‘What boots the godless giant to provoke ,
Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke ?
Already when the dreadful rock he threw ,
Old Ocean shook , and back his surges flew .
The sounding voice directs his aim again ;
The rock o’erwhelms us , and we ’scaped in vain . ’",""" He got more and more furious as he heard me , so he tore the top from off a high mountain , and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder . The sea quaked as the rock fell into it , and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland , and forced us towards the shore . But I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off , making signs to my men by nodding my head , that they must row for their lives , whereon they laid out with a will . When we had got twice as far as we were before , I was for jeering at the Cyclops again , but the men begged and prayed of me to hold my tongue .

"" ' Do not , ' they exclaimed , ' be mad enough to provoke this savage creature further ; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the mainland , and we made sure it had been the death of us ; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship ' s timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us , for he can throw them a long way . '","The blind thing in his doubled fury broke
a hilltop in his hands and heaved it after us .
Ahead of our black prow it struck and sank
whelmed in a spuming geyser , a giant wave
that washed the ship stem foremost back to shore .
I got the longest boathook out and stood
fending us off , with furious nods to all
to put their backs into a racing stroke--
row , row , or perish . So the long oars bent
kicking the foam sternward , making head
until we drew away , and twice as far .
Now when I cupped my hands I heard the crew
in low voices protesting : ' Godsake , Captain !
Why bait the beast again ? Let him alone ! '
That tidal wave he made on the first throw
all but beached us . ' ' All but stove us in ! '
' Give him our bearing with your trumpeting ,
he ' ll get the range and lob a boulder . ' ' Aye
He ' ll smash our timbers and our heads together ! '","He was even angrier when he heard this .
Breaking off the peak of a huge crag
He threw it toward our ship , and it carried
To just in front of our dark prow . The sea
Billowed up where the rock came down ,
And the backwash pushed us to the mainland again ,
Like a flood tide setting us down at the shore .
I grabbed a long pole and shoved us off ,
Nodding to the crew to fall on the oars
And get us out of there . They leaned into it ,
And when we were twice as far out to sea as before
I called to the Cyclops again , with my men
Hanging all over me and begging me not to :
‘Don’t do it , man ! The rock that hit the water
Pushed us in and we thought we were done for .
If he hears any sound from us , he’ll heave
Half a cliff at us and crush the ship and our skulls
With one throw . You know he has the range . ’","My taunting made him angrier . He ripped
a rock out of the hill and hurled it at us .
It landed right in front of our dark prow ,
and almost crushed the tip of the steering oar .
The stone sank in the water ; waves surged up .
The backflow all at once propelled the ship
landwards ; the swollen water pushed us with it .
I grabbed a big long pole , and shoved us off .
I told my men , ‘Row fast , to save your lives ! ’
and gestured with my head to make them hurry .
They bent down to their oars and started rowing .
We got out twice as far across the sea ,
and then I called to him again . My crew
begged me to stop , and pleaded with me . ‘Please !
Calm down ! Why are you being so insistent
and taunting this wild man ? He hurled that stone
and drove our ship right back to land . We thought
that we were going to die . If he had heard us ,
he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed
our heads and wooden ship . He throws so hard !"

Impossible things , in fear ; but I gave way
To that wrath which so long I held deprest ,
By great necessity conquer’d , in my breast :
‘Cyclop ! if any ask thee , who impos’d
Th’ unsightly blemish that thine eye enclos’d ,
Say that Ulysses , old Laertes’ son ,
Whose seat is Ithaca , and who hath won
Surname of City-razer , bor’d it out . ’
At this , he bray’d so loud , that round about
He drave affrighted echoes through the air ,
And said : ‘O beast ! I was premonish’d fair ,
By aged prophecy , in one that was
A great and good man , this should come to pass ;
And how ’tis prov’d now ! Augur Telemus ,
Surnam’d Eurymides ( that spent with us
His age in augury , and did exceed
In all presage of truth ) said all this deed
Should this event take , author’d by the hand
Of one Ulysses , who I thought was mann’d
With great and goodly personage , and bore
A virtue answerable ; and this shore
Should shake with weight of such a conqueror ;
When now a weakling came , a dwarfy thing ,
A thing of nothing ; who yet wit did bring ,
That brought supply to all , and with his wine
Put out the flame where all my light did shine .
Come , land again , Ulysses ! that my hand
May guest-rites give thee , and the great command ,
That Neptune hath at sea , I may convert
To the deduction where abides thy heart ,
With my solicitings , whose son I am ,
And whose fame boasts to bear my father’s name .
Nor think my hurt offends me , for my sire
Can soon repose in it the visual fire ,
At his free pleasure ; which no pow’r beside
Can boast , of men , or of the Deified . ’",""" But I , of mind elate , and scorning fear ,
Thus with new taunts insult the monster’s ear :
‘Cyclop ! if any , pitying thy disgrace .
Ask , who disfigured thus that eyeless face ?
Say ’twas Ulysses : ’twas his deed declare ,
Laertes’ son , of Ithaca the fair ;
Ulysses , far in fighting fields renown’d ,
Before whose arm Troy tumbled to the ground . ’

"" The astonished savage with a roar replies :
‘Oh heavens ! oh faith of ancient prophecies !
This , Telemus Eurymedes foretold
( The mighty seer who on these hills grew old ;
Skill’d the dark fates of mortals to declare ,
And learn’d in all wing’d omens of the air ) ;
Long since he menaced , such was Fate’s command ;
And named Ulysses as the destined hand .
I deem’d some godlike giant to behold ,
Or lofty hero , haughty , brave , and bold ;
Not this weak pigmy wretch , of mean design ,
Who , not by strength subdued me , but by wine .
But come , accept our gifts , and join to pray
Great Neptune’s blessing on the watery way ;
For his I am , and I the lineage own ;
The immortal father no less boasts the son .
His power can heal me , and relight my eye ;
And only his , of all the gods on high . ’",""" But I would not listen to them , and shouted out to him in my rage , ' Cyclops , if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty , say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses , son of Laertes , who lives in Ithaca . '

"" On this he groaned , and cried out , ' Alas , alas , then the old prophecy about me is coming true . There was a prophet here , at one time , a man both brave and of great stature , Telemus son of Eurymus , who was an excellent seer , and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he grew old ; he told me that all this would happen to me some day , and said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses . I have been all along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength , whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling , who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink ; come here , then , Ulysses , that I may make you presents to show my hospitality , and urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey- for Neptune and I are father and son . He , if he so will , shall heal me , which no one else neither god nor man can do . '","I would not heed them in my glorying spirit ,
but let my anger flare and yelled : ' Kyklops ,
if ever mortal man inquire
how you were put to shame and blinded , tell him
Odysseus , raider of cities , took your eye ;
Laertes ' son , whose home ' s on Ithaka ! '
At this he gave a mighty sob and rumbled :
*Now comes the weird upon me , spoken of old .
A wizard , grand and wondrous , lived here—Télemos ,
a son of Eurymos ; great length of days
he had in wizardry among the Kyklopês ,
and these things he foretold for time to come :
my great eye lost , and at Odysseus ' hands .
Always I had in mind some giant , armed
in giant force , would come against me here .
But this , but you—small , pitiful and twiggy—
you put me down with wine , you blinded me .
Come back , Odysseus , and I ' ll treat you well ,
praying the god of earthquake to befriend you—
his son I am , for he by his avowal
fathered me , and , if he will , he may
heal me of this black wound—he and no other
of all the happy gods or mortal men . '","They tried , but didn’t persuade my hero’s heart—
I was really angry—and I called back to him :
‘Cyclops , if anyone , any mortal man ,
Asks you how you got your eye put out ,
Tell him that Odysseus the marauder did it ,
Son of Laertes , whose home is on Ithaca . ’
He groaned , and had this to say in response :
‘Oh no ! Now it’s coming to me , the old prophecy .
There was a seer here once , a tall handsome man ,
Telemos Eurymides . He prophesied well
All his life to the Cyclopes . He told me
That all this would happen some day ,
That I would lose my sight at Odysseus’ hands .
I always expected a great hero
Would come here , strong as can be .
Now this puny , little , good-for-nothing runt
Has put my eye out—because he got me drunk .
But come here , Odysseus , so I can give you a gift ,
And ask Poseidon to help you on your way .
I’m his son , you know . He claims he’s my father .
He will heal me , if he wants . But none
Of the other gods will , and no mortal man will . ’","But my tough heart was not convinced ; I was
still furious , and shouted back again ,
‘Cyclops ! If any mortal asks you how
your eye was mutilated and made blind ,
say that Odysseus , the city-sacker ,
Laertes’ son , who lives in Ithaca ,
destroyed your sight . ’ He groaned , ‘The prophecy !
It has come true at last ! There was a tall
and handsome man named Telemus , the son
of Eurymus , who lived among my people ;
he spent his life here , soothsaying for us .
He told me that Odysseus’ hands
would make me lose my sight . I always thought
a tall and handsome man would visit me ,
endowed with strength and courage . But this weakling ,
this little nobody , has blinded me ;
by wine he got the best of me . Come on ,
Odysseus , and let me give you gifts ,
and ask Poseidon’ s help to get you home .
I am his son ; the god is proud to be
my father . He will heal me , if he wants ,
though no one else , not god nor man , can do it . ’"

Both life and soul from thee , and send to hell
Those spoils of nature ! Hardly Neptune then
Could cure thy hurt , and give thee all again . ’
Then flew fierce vows to Neptune , both his hands
To star-born heav’n cast : ‘O thou that all lands
Gird’st in thy ambient circle , and in air
Shak’st the curl’d tresses of thy sapphire hair ,
If I be thine , or thou mayst justly vaunt
Thou art my father , hear me now , and grant
That this Ulysses , old Laertes’ son ,
That dwells in Ithaca , and name hath won
Of City-ruiner , may never reach
His natural region . Or if to fetch
That , and the sight of his fair roofs and friends ,
Be fatal to him , let him that amends
For all his miseries , long time and ill ,
Smart for , and fail of ; nor that fate fulfill ,
Till all his soldiers quite are cast away
In others’ ships . And when , at last , the day
Of his sole-landing shall his dwelling show ,
Let Detriment prepare him wrongs enow . ’
Thus pray’d he Neptune ; who , his sire , appear’d ,
And all his pray’r to ev’ry syllable heard .
But then a rock , in size more amplified
Than first , he ravish’d to him , and implied
A dismal strength in it , when , wheel’d about ,
He sent it after us ; nor flew it out
From any blind aim , for a little pass
Beyond our fore-deck from the fall there was ,
With which the sea our ship gave back upon ,
And shrunk up into billows from the stone ,
Our ship again repelling near as near
The shore as first .",""" ‘Oh ! could this arm ( I thus aloud rejoin’d )
From that vast bulk dislodge thy bloody mind ,
And send thee howling to the realms of night !
As sure as Neptune cannot give thee sight . ’
"" Thus I ; while raging he repeats his cries ,
With hands uplifted to the starry skies ?
‘Hear me , O Neptune ; thou whose arms are hurl’d
From shore to shore , and gird the solid world ;
If thine I am , nor thou my birth disown ,
And if the unhappy Cyclop be thy son ,
Let not Ulysses breathe his native air ,
Laertes’ son , of Ithaca the fair .
If to review his country be his fate ,
Be it through toils and sufferings long and late ;
His lost companions let him first deplore ;
Some vessel , not his own , transport him o’er ;
And when at home from foreign sufferings freed ,
More near and deep , domestic woes succeed ! ’
With imprecations thus he fill’d the air ,
And angry Neptune heard the unrighteous prayer ,
A larger rock then heaving from the plain ,
He whirl’d it round : it sung across the main ;
It fell , and brush’d the stern : the billows roar ,
Shake at the weight , and refluent beat the shore .",""" Then I said , ' I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and sending you down to the house of Hades , as I am that it will take more than Neptune to cure that eye of yours . '

"" On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed , saying , ' Hear me , great Neptune ; if I am indeed your own true-begotten son , grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive ; or if he must get back to his friends at last , let him do so late and in sore plight after losing all his men [ let him reach his home in another man ' s ship and find trouble in his house . ' ]

"" Thus did he pray , and Neptune heard his prayer . Then he picked up a rock much larger than the first , swung it aloft and hurled it with prodigious force . It fell just short of the ship , but was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder . The sea quaked as the rock fell into it , and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way towards the shore of the island .","Few words I shouted in reply to him :
' If I could take your life I would and take
your time away , and hurl you down to hell !
The god of earthquake could not heal you there ! '
At this he stretched his hands out in his darkness
toward the sky of stars , and prayed Poseidon :
' O hear me , lord , blue girdler of the islands ,
if I am thine indeed , and thou art father :
grant that Odysseus , raider of cities , never
see his home : Laërtês ' son , I mean ,
who kept his hall on Ithaka . Should destiny
intend that he shall see his roof again
among his family in his father land ,
far be that day , and dark the years between .
Let him lose all companions , and return
under strange sail to bitter days at home . '
In these words he prayed , and the god heard him .
Now he laid hands upon a bigger stone
and wheeled around , titanic for the cast ,
to let it fly in the black-prowed vessel ' s track .
But it fell short , just aft the steering oar ,
and whelming seas rose giant above the stone
to bear us onward toward the island .","He spoke , and I shouted back to him :
‘I wish I were as sure of ripping out your lungs
And sending you to Hell as I am dead certain
That not even the Earthshaker will heal your eye . ’
I had my say , and he prayed to Poseidon ,
Stretching his arms out to starry heaven :
‘Hear me , Poseidon , blue-maned Earth-Holder ,
If you are the father you claim to be .
Grant that Odysseus , son of Laertes ,
May never reach his home on Ithaca .
But if he is fated to see his family again ,
And return to his home and own native land ,
May he come late , having lost all companions ,
In another’s ship , and find trouble at home . ’
He prayed , and the blue-maned sea-god heard him .
Then he broke off an even larger chunk of rock ,
Pivoted , and threw it with incredible force .
It came down just behind our dark-hulled ship ,
Barely missing the end of the rudder . The sea
Billowed up where the rock hit the water ,
And the wave pushed us forward all the way","After he said these words , I answered him ,
‘If only I could steal your life from you ,
and send you down to Hades’ house below ,
as sure as nobody will ever heal you ,
even the god of earthquakes . ’ But he prayed
holding his arms towards the starry sky ,
‘Listen , Earth-Shaker , Blue-Haired Lord Poseidon :
acknowledge me your son , and be my father .
Grant that Odysseus , the city-sacker ,
will never go back home . Or if it is
fated that he will see his family ,
then let him get there late and with no honor ,
in pain and lacking ships , and having caused
the death of all his men , and let him find
more trouble in his own house . ’ Blue Poseidon
granted his son’s prayer . Polyphemus raised
a rock far bigger than the last , and swung ,
then hurled it with immeasurable force .
It fell a little short , beside our rudder ,
and splashed into the sea ; the waves surged up ,
and pushed the boat ahead , to the other shore ."

The other island , where our whole fleet lay ,
In which our friends lay mourning for our stay ,
And ev’ry minute look’d when we should land .
Where , now arriv’d , we drew up to the sand ,
The Cyclops’ sheep dividing , that none there
Of all our privates might be wrung , and bear
Too much on pow’r . The ram yet was alone
By all my friends made all my portion
Above all others ; and I made him then
A sacrifice for me and all my men
To cloud-compelling Jove that all commands ,
To whom I burn’d the thighs ; but my sad hands
Receiv’d no grace from him , who studied how
To offer men and fleet to overthrow .

All day , till sun-set , yet , we sat and eat ,
And lib’ral store took in of wine and meat .
The sun then down , and place resign’d to shade ,
We slept . Morn came , my men I rais’d , and made
All go aboard , weigh anchor , and away .
They boarded , sat , and beat the aged sea ;
And forth we made sail , sad for loss before ,
Any yet had comfort since we lost no more . ""","With all our force we kept aloof to sea ,

Our sight the whole collected navy cheer’d .
Who , waiting long , by turns had hoped and fear’d .
There disembarking on the green sea side ,
We land our cattle , and the spoil divide ;
Of these due shares to every sailor fall ;
The master ram was voted mine by all ;
And him ( the guardian of Ulysses’ fate )
With pious mind to heaven I consecrate .
But the great god , whose thunder rends the skies ,
Averse , beholds the smoking sacrifice ;
And sees me wandering still from coast to coast ,
And all my vessels , all my people , lost !
While thoughtless we indulge the genial rite ,
As plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite ;
Till evening Phœbus roll’d away the light ;
Stretch’d on the shore in careless ease we rest ,
Till ruddy morning purpled o’er the east ;
Then from their anchors all our ships unbind ,
And mount the decks , and call the willing wind .
Now , ranged in order on our banks we sweep .
With hasty strokes the hoarse-resounding deep ;
Blind to the future , pensive with our fears ,
Glad for the living , for the dead in tears . """,""" When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our ships , we found our comrades lamenting us , and anxiously awaiting our return . We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea shore ; we also landed the Cyclops ' sheep , and divided them equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain . As for the ram , my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share ; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore , and burned its thigh bones to Jove , who is the lord of all . But he heeded not my sacrifice , and only thought how he might destroy my ships and my comrades .

"" Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink , but when the sun went down and it came on dark , we camped upon the beach . When the child of morning , rosy-fingered Dawn , appeared , I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers . Then they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars ; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts , but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades .","There
as we ran in we saw the squadron waiting ,
the trim ships drawn up side by side , and all
our troubled friends who waited , looking seaward .
We beached her , grinding keel in the soft sand ,
and waded in , ourselves , on the sandy beach .
Then we unloaded all the Kyklops ' flock
to make division , share and share alike ,
only my fighters voted that my ram ,
the prize of all , should go to me . I slew him
by the sea side and burnt his long thighbones
to Zeus beyond the stormcloud , Kronos ' son ,
who rules the world . But Zeus disdained my offering ;
destruction for my ships he had in store
and death for those who sailed them , my companions .
Now all day long until the sun went down
we made our feast on mutton and sweet wine ,
till after sunset in the gathering dark
we went to sleep above the wash of ripples .
When the young Dawn with finger tips of rose
touched the world , I roused the men , gave orders
to man the ships , cast off the mooring lines ;
and filing in to sit beside the rowlocks
oarsmen in line dipped oars in the grey sea .
So we moved out , sad in the vast offing ,
having our precious lives , but not our friends .","To the island where our other ships waited
Clustered on the shore , ringed by our comrades
Sitting on the sand , anxious for our return .
We beached the ship and unloaded the Cyclops’ sheep ,
Which I divided up as fairly as I could
Among all hands . The veterans gave me the great ram ,
And I sacrificed it on the shore of the sea
To Zeus in the dark clouds , who rules over all .
I burnt the thigh pieces , but the god did not accept
My sacrifice , brooding over how to destroy
All my benched ships and my trusty crews .
So all the long day until the sun went down
We sat feasting on meat and drinking sweet wine .
When the sun set and darkness came on
We lay down and slept on the shore of the sea
Early in the morning , when the sky was streaked red ,
I roused my men and ordered the crews
To get on deck and cast off . They took their places
And were soon whitening the sea with their oars .
We sailed on in shock , glad to get away alive
But grieving for the comrades we had lost . ""","We reached the island where our ships were docked .
The men were sitting waiting for us , weeping .
We beached our ship and disembarked , then took
the sheep that we had stolen from the Cyclops
out of the ship’s hold , and we shared them out
fairly , so all the men got equal portions .
But in dividing up the flock , my crew
gave me alone the ram , the Cyclops’ favorite .
There on the shore , I slaughtered him for Zeus ,
the son of Cronus , god of Dark Clouds , Lord
of all the world . I burned the thighs . The god
ignored my offering , and planned to ruin
all of my ships and all my loyal men .
So all day long till sunset we were sitting ,
feasting on meat and drinking sweet strong wine .
But when the sun went down and darkness fell ,
we went to sleep beside the breaking waves .
Then when rose-fingered Dawn came , bright and early ,
I roused my men and told them to embark
and loose the cables . Quickly they obeyed ,
sat at their rowing benches , all in order ,
and struck the gray saltwater with their oars .
So we sailed on , with sorrow in our hearts ,
glad to survive , but grieving for our friends . """
