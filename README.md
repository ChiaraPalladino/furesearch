If you have a topic you would like to bring to everyone's attention, you may use the GitHub discussions feature: https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/discussions. 

This feature is useful for showing stuff you have done, or for extended discussions related to things you have discovered, or for the description of milestones you have reached. I recommend using https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/discussions/categories/milestones-show-and-tell for describing weekly tasks you have completed.
