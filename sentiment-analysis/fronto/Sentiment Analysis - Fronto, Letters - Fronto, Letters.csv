Nam illius quidem , ut Plautus ait , amoris imber grandibus guttis non vestem modo permanavit , sed in medullam ultro pluit .",Positive,"I see I shall have a competitor in Gratia, and I fear that I may not be able to surpass her. For, as Plautus Says, in her case, “not only has the rain of love drenched her dress with its thunder-drops, but soaked into her very marrow.”",,"lowers his own position but only to compliment someone = pos. despite using ""i fear"" its positive since his tone for the whole letter is lighthearted"
