# Mapping Commentary (and Points for Review)
### This is an aggregate of all of my commentary in mapping the _Anabasis_, similar to my notable annotations and commentary list, mostly so that it's on record. **Partway through I swap from 1st draft to 2nd draft notes!** So keep an eye out for that.
Update as of 7/12/24: I also swap to 3rd draft notes for Book 4, which begin again after crossing the Centrities (4.3.1). Additionally, Book 4 has four possible routes plotted, centered on two criteria: 1) Whether Xenophon's Euphrates is the Murat or the Karasu, and 2) Whether the Ten Thousand marched seven days to the Phasis or seven days along the Phasis


Also, here's a cheat sheet for the measurements Xenophon uses. They are all not exactly known in the modern day, and even back then they were variable, meaning that they weren't concrete distances but more often how long it took to get somewhere, but it's the best he gives us. When interpreting these measurements, I use a range of values.
* _Stadion_
    * Not precisely known
    * 1 stadion = ~184m (150-210m)
* _Parasang_
    * Not precisely know; a measure of walking distance; potentially based on how far a soldier could march a day
    * 1 parasang = ~30 stadia
    * 1 parasang = ~5.4km (4.7-5.6km)
* _Stage_
    * Not precisely known; really only shows up in Xenophon’s Anabasis
    * There’s also desert stages too? Implying that a stage could also be a relative measure of marching distance, like parasang, that would be impacted by terrain
    * 1 stage = 160 stadia
    * 1 stage = ~29.8km (24-33.6km)

## Book 2 (1st DRAFT NOTES)
* I’m having Book 2 start at the reference point Pleiades gives for the wall of Media (33.1216, 44.2698) and not where Wikipedia roughly lists the Battle of Cunaxa as having occurred (33.325, 44.08) because:
    * It’s where I left off in book 1
    * **The Pleiades reference point is not actually the Median Wall**, but the defensive ditch Artaxerxes II carved that reaches to it, that Pleiades labels the Wall of Media. The actual Median Wall may be a bit further south/southeast, since it’s only said to be “where the length between the Tigris and Euphrates narrows considerably”
* The Battle of Cunaxa is stated to have happened on the left bank of the Euphrates, yet the coords for it place it almost directly between the Tigris and Euphrates
    * Towards the beginning of book 2, Xenophon states that the journey from Ephesus to the battlefield  has been 93 stages/535 parasangs/16,050 stadia, and from the battlefield to Babylon is 360 stadia
        * Now stadia nor parasangs nor stages are precise measurements that we can directly calculate to the modern day, BUT if we work within a range of values (1 parasang = 4.7-5.6km) (1 stadion = 150-210m) (1 stage=29.8km), this area seems reasonable. From this battlefield point, the center of Babylon is ~66.45km away, which is already within the range given, not accounting for whether it was measured from the battlefield to the city walls or city center, how big and where the battlefield was, etc., which are accommodated to a reasonable extent
    * HOWEVER, in Book 1 they don’t actually reach the Wall of Media itself, but a defensive canal dug near it
    * Furthermore, in Book 2 it’s implied they travel at least a little bit until they reach the Wall of Media
    * MY CURRENT THEORY is that the Pleiades point for the Wall of Media is part of the defensive canal that flows northwest to southeast, semi-parallel to the Euphrates (since it’s said it empties into the Euphrates, or at the very least gets very close, creating a passage only about 20 (greek?) feet in width) 
        * In Book 1 Cyrus is said to have traveled for 3 days, growing more lax in defense each day, but no measurements are given until well after he’s dead, when Artaxerxes II’s troops storm Cyrus’ and Ariaeus’ camp, and the soldiers retreat to their setting-off point earlier in the day (which was about 4 parasangs away)
        * Given that he was likely marching towards Babylon, they probably traveled south from the Pleiades Wall of Media reference point, fought near the bend in the Euphrates where the Median Wall may actually be (or at least before the space between the Euphrates and Tigris widens again), then the soldiers backtracked and fled up ~4 parasangs
         * Given all that, they potentially backtracked back to the reference point, so I will be starting Book 2 from this reference point
* Given the almost contemporary status of Xenophon and Herodotus, the two Greek authors to earliest and widely make use of parasangs in their writings, and given the pre existing scholarship on the topic **(Rood, T. (2010). _Xenophon's parasangs._ https://doi.org/10.1017/s0075426910000042)**, I’m going to go with the idea that parasangs are variable, and I am going to borrow Herodotus’ assertion that an “army moves [roughy] 5 parasangs per day” when trying to calculate distances where Xenophon measures in days (such as the beginning of book 2)
    * Applies to 2.2.13 march
    * For 2.3.14 guided march, no days nor distance is given, so I’m assuming half a day at most, though it could be less because maybe Xenophon didn’t think it was enough to merit measurements
        * Also the direction is up in the air. Since they have to eventually get to Opis, and the king is guiding them and is based out of Babylon, south/southeast felt like a solid guess
* From the 2.3.14 villages they encounter the actual Median Wall after marching 3 stages. Even with the most conservative measure of distance, this is an absurdly huge zone. Even if my previous estimations (where they first encountered the trench, the battlefield location, their falling back point) are, which to an extent they no-doubt are, they would have to be wrong by such a wide margin that it contradicts measurements Xenophon previously gave. Maybe an instance of Xenophon forgot?
    * Now here’s a thought. Xenophon says it’s “not too far distant from Babylon” (2.4.12), and there are so many different rivers and tributaries in this area. The Wall is said to be built at a narrowing of the Tigris and Euphrates, but where this area would seem to be doesn’t make sense geographically. However, if it was between two tributaries of the Tigris and Euphrates, or rivers that were mistaken as the two, it could be much closer to Babylon and potentially line up with the measurements more.
        * Highly unlikely that people have been misidentifying the location for ~2500 years, and this thought fully comes from trying to treat subjective measurements as objective, but I’m coping okay
* The measurements here are all sorts of wonky. This part actually lines up reasonably with where I put the Median Wall, and therefore where they would’ve passed inside, but that also contradicts the measurements given before and after
* Where I estimated Sittace to be on the map that makes sense with Xenophon’s journey measurements, the fact that they haven’t crossed the Tigris yet (ie on the Babylon side), and 15 stadia (2.25km) from the river
    * HOWEVER, that’s not particularly in the bounds of Sittacene as it’s represented on Pleiades, so who knows, this whole section is going to have to be heavily reviewed anyway
* The measurements Xenophon gives from Sittace to Opis all like eight degrees of wonked, and there’s just no way they work geographically. I desperately need to review and basically redo this entire section, since right now the only possible way it works is: Opis is misidentified (either by Xenophon or modern day scholars), all the preceding measurements are wrong, or Xenophon is extremely wrong right now
* Distance from Opis to “villages of Parysatis” (2.4.27) lines up refreshingly well. If anything, it might be a bit short (potentially due to “desert stages”; I assume they can cover greater distances on flat desert terrain?)
    * Nevermind it actually might be nowhere near long enough, because immediately after it says they pass by Cenae in the first stage of their 4 desert stage march, and where these villages are estimated right now they can barely even reach Cenae by the end of the march
* As it stands, they have to get to the Zapatas river (2.5.1) by the end of Book 2, so measurements be damned I put them there

## Book 3 (1st DRAFT NOTES)
* Where exactly they crossed the Zapatas (3.3.6) is up for debate
    * The wording in 3.4.6 implies that they weren’t already following the Tigris when they crossed the Zapatas, so they may have crossed it’s headwaters further up then went northwest at a diagonal, reaching the Tigris and Larisa
* No distance measurements are given from 3.3.11 onward to Larisa. For my estimations right now, they only would’ve marched just over 9km, which seems short given that they could likely cover 27km a day
    * They did have a skirmish with Persian troops, and spend time crossing a gorge, so it’s likely they wouldn’t be traveling 27km this day, but it could reasonably be more than 9, supporting that they crossed the Zapatas not as close to the Tigris
* The actual distance from Larisa to Mespila isn’t completely accurate with Xenophon’s measurements, but only by a few km. Also doesn’t explicitly mention crossing the Tigris, even though he would have to
    * Could also be a measurement error with my projection system
* At 3.4.18, they’re said to have marched a day with no destination, distance measurements, or any further elaboration given. Currently assuming this is at a normal pace (5 parasangs/day), and is separate from a measurement of 4 stages they’re said to have traveled in 3.4.23

## Book 4 (1st DRAFT NOTES)
* I’ve come to the conclusion that I think I’ve been completely wrong on this first draft of mapping
    * Given this, I’ve decided to continue on as if this was correct, then probably just redo the whole thing
    * They in fact have not crossed the Tigris at all, and I think that’s where I went wrong

# Here's Where I do-over: 
### The next notes are formatted more concisely. Some are copy-pasted from the original 1st draft becasue they're the same issues, but there's also additional commentary.

## Book 2 (2nd DRAFT NOTES)
* (2.4.27) Opis to villages of Parysatis(?)
    * The distance actually seems way too short given that he says his next journey passes by Cenae in the first stage, while with current measurements he could barely reach it by the end of the 4th stage
         * It could be that either Cenae and Opis are misidentified. However, Pleiades’ certainty rating is “certain” for both. Of the two, Opis seems more likely that it would be wrong though because the measurements going into and coming out of it don’t line up, nor does it’s position in relation to the Physcus river. 	One source (Mason, Kenneth. “Notes on the Canal System and Ancient Sites of Babylonia in the Time of Xenophon.” The Geographical Journal 56, no. 6 (1920): 468–81. https://doi.org/10.2307/1780469.) says it’s under or immediately north of the ruins of Aski Baghdad, but I can find zero accurate coordinates that line up with where that is
             * Now that I’m looking at it closer, the Physcus river doesn’t seem to be accurate at all. It’s identified with the Tornadotus on wikipedia, however Pleiades instead links it to the Diyala river, but that location still seems off relative to Opis
             * Looking at it, there seems to be a river that is just not identified (right now tentatively Tornadotus/Phsycus) near where Opis Diabas/Turnat reference points are, then above that should be the Diyala, then the Lesser Zab, then the Great Zab
             * Further evidence that there’s something up with the identification of Tornadotus vs Physcus vs Diyala is that Xenophon never says they cross another river before reaching the villages of Parysatis, where they should at least be crossing the Diyala
* (2.4.28) Villages of Parysatis(?) to Cenae and Zapatas river
    * Further evidence that there’s something up with the identification of Tornadotus vs Physcus vs Diyala is that Xenophon never says they cross another river before reaching the Zapatas, where they should at least be crossing Diyala to get to the villages of Parysatis, and the Little Zab to get to Cenae
    * Can never rule out that Xenophon simply forgot, but the Little Zab especially seems bigger than the Phycus, which seems worthy of a mention
        * Have to check the calendar, but they may have been traveling in winter, aka dry season, so the rivers would’ve been much less
* (3.3.11) Zapatas crossing
    * Still unclear on if they crossed the Zapatas close to the tigris or not. No evidence they didn’t, but if they did, they should be able to travel further in the next segment, unless the skirmish really took a long time

## Book 3 (2nd DRAFT NOTES)
* (3.4.1) Gorge and Persian skirmish to Larisa
    * Can’t find any geographic equivalent nearby of where this gorge might be
    * Also, unless the skirmish took a really long time, which it doesn’t seem like it did and rather Xenophon describes it as if the Greeks made short work of the Persians, they should be able to travel much further than Larisa
* (3.4.10) Larisa to Mespila
    * The distance lines up perfectly with the range of values given. The only problem is that the Mespila reference point is on the opposite side of the Tigris, and they haven't crossed yet (made the mistake of mapping it like they had before)
* (3.4.16) Mespila to 3.4.18 villages(?)
    *  No direction given; assuming they followed the Tigris
* 3.4.18 villages(?) to 3.4.19 stopping point(?)
    * No direction, destination, or distance measurements given. Assuming they followed the Tigris still. The ArcGIS basemap shows a lake as part of the Tigris, but the CAWM doesn't, only showing a basin; traced around it as if lake; doesn't effect journey
    * 1 day’s march at 27km seems excessive for this region, even though it lines up (or in some cases is even smaller) than typical historical figures 
* (3.4.28) 4 stages from 3.4.18 stopping point
    * No direction or much elaboration given. They actually proceed five stages, but the action picks up midway throught their fifth stage, so I made it a separate segment
    * 4 stages at ~30km a stage seems extremely excessive for this region, because if they traveled 120km they'd be right in the middle of Karduchoi here. Even with a windy path and mountainous terrain, there’s only so much that can be done
    * There’s also no mention of them crossing or even encountering the Little Khabur that flows into the Tigris. They could’ve gone around it, but that doesn’t explain why Xenophon didn’t mention it
    * Also the action cuts back in in the middle of the fifth stage near a mountain crossing, and I cannot figure out where that is. There’s more mountains here than Xenophon seems to have recognized
        * At first glance, and with the distances still to go, it would seem to be the range just south of the Khabur Tigris that pulls in close to the Tigris river, then they stomp around that river valley north for a bit before resolving to go into the Carduchian mountains
        * There’s a path further north, but it’s basically at the entrance to the Carduchian mountains, so that seems like it’d be later, even though it’s closer to the measurement distance Xenophon gives here
            * This actually might be it, and Karduchoi is further north than I thought
                * Nevermind, doesn’t line up with when they claim they can no longer follow the Tigris, nor with the terrain description of them still being in plains
    * I think I’m gonna bite the bullet, say Xenophon screwed up his measurements, and keep going
* (3.4.24) March through fifth stage
    * This also again seems exceptionally long. They did skirmish with the Persians here, but it doesn’t seem like it was enough to slow their progress.
        * Running into major problems where Xenophon's measurements drastically overshoot the geographic space
    * Still, given the skirmish, hill terrain, and need for more space, I put them slightly within the radius of a conservative estimate of day’s travel
    * Also says for their next leg the descend into the plain, so for this I put them partially up a mountain

## Book 4 (2nd DRAFT NOTES)
* 3.5.13 villages(?) to 4.1.5 mountain(?)
     * There's no measurements or timeframe given beyond they left after the night's "last watch" and arrived "at daybreak" (4.1.5). Given that, I used no radius and just mapped them along the quickest path to the mountain pass
* 4.1.5 stopping point(?) to 4.1.11 villages(?)
     * Inside radius. Traveled at a slow pace, and Xenophon reports it took the whole day to ascend and descend the mountain. Looked at the 3D map, followed a pass, and mapped until they descended the mountain
* 4.1.11 villages(?) to 4.1.14 stopping point(?)
     * Inside the radius, but the measurement of the specific route is almost exactly a full day's march. Followed terrain for easiest logical path. Intentionally stopped short of full distance because Xenophon said they rest and fought a bit throughout.
* 4.1.14 stopping point(?) to 4.2.4 stopping point(?)
     * Extremely tedious section. No clear measurements, a day’s travel is only implied, and the terrain descriptions are constantly broken up by descriptions of battles and tactics. Given distances, possible routes, terrain descriptions, and the severe storm and skirmishes they’re said to endure, I put them within the radius
* 4.2.4 stopping point(?) to 4.2.22 houses(?)
     * They fought a battle for mountain passes this whole day
     * There's zero indication of where they traveled or how far, but it since they stopped after the battle in the Carduchians' homes, it's likely they just crossed the mountain
     * The geography in this region is simultaneously detailed, vague, and very confusing, but my best guesses as to the mountain passes are where they stopped in the previous segment and a pass a few km east of there
          * The pass to the east is the best in the area that matches Xenophon’s descriptions of hills, seemingly being easy enough for baggage animals to traverse, while still making sense with his journey as plotted
* 4.2.22 houses(?) to 4.3.1 villages(?)
     * Relatively flat terrain, though not perfectly so. Also, they were consistently slowed by Carduchians, so that would affect progress. Still relatively close to radius. Put them on hills above Centrities because of terrain description
     * Next section talks about a particular ford to cross the Centrities with precise measurements (4 stadia=~840m). After measuring a bunch of different angles, I think it’s 4 stadia from their village, so I put the stopping point for this segment where that measurement would fit
 * 4.3.1 villages(?) to 4.4.2 village(?)
     * 5 parasangs seems a little much since that's a full day's march, and they only started at midday. Xenophon describes terrain as flat and pleasant, so that could help. Terrain doesn't actually look that flat, though compared to Karduchoi it certainly is
          * Nowhere along the Centrities is there terrain that’s perfectly flat though, but where they are is about as flat as it gets
     * They pass a river (Mansur Creek?) that Xenophon doesn’t mention at all, even though they have to cross it to keep going
          * Could be that it was winter and the creek was dried up
          * Could be that it didn’t even exist in 400 BCE
          * Could be that it was negligible enough he chose not or forgot to mention it
* 4.4.2 villages(?) to "Tigris headwaters"(?)
     * 10 parasangs is an impossible distance for this region
     * The “Tigris headwaters” are also way further west than the Teleboas (general consensus is that the Tigris originates from Lake Harpazus), physically impossible for Xenophon to have encountered. Either:
          * Xenophon misidentified the Tigris headwaters (possibly as Yanarsu Stream). This is what I went with
          * Xenophon actually means he was upstream of the Tigris (also possible, but it still doesn’t work with the distances, and he’d have to cross some mountains to see it, which he doesn’t mention)
* "Tigris headwaters"(?) to 4.4.3 Teleboas villages(?)
     * 15 parasangs is an impossible distance for this region.
* 4.4.3 Teleboas villages(?) to 4.4.7 villages(?)
     * 15 parasangs stretches plausibility, though it's not impossible, especially with hilly terrain. Xenophon describes the terrain as "level", but it is most certainly not. It's not extremely mountainous, however
* 4.4.7 villages(?) to 4.5.1 stopping point(?)
     * No measurements here, just that they raced away from Tiribazus to avoid being killed in the mountain passes. Can't find any pass through this mountain range besides the Teleboas, so I'm going to assume there was a road along it
     * Also unclear where they exited, but I’m going to go with the route that lines up best with a day’s distance
* 4.5.1 stopping point(?) to Euphrates crossing(?) 
     * Translation says they “traveled through desert terrain,” but looking at the terrain it doesn’t seem much like desert
          * Xenophon uses ἐρήμους (same way he denotes “desert stages” like 2.4.27), so it could be more accurate to say the country is lonely or desolate, which makes sense given the heavy snowfall they just had
     * 15 parasangs might actually be a tad short, but then again maybe not. It’s all dependent on where they crossed the Euphrates
          * Given that they said they marched to the Euphrates and crossed it, I put their crossing towards the end of the radius
* Euphrates crossing(?) to 4.5.5 stopping place(?)
     * This is immediately after reading all of those articles, and my current conclusion is that I’m gonna do my own thing
     * Says they marched through mostly plains, and this area is the largest stretch of mostly plains around. No direction given, but since Xenophon likely misidentifies the Araxes as the Phasis, I'm putting him in that direction
* 4.5.5 stopping place(?) to 4.5.9 village(?)
     * No direction or distance measurements given. Inside radius due to winding, but the path mapped is a full day's length
     * Xenophon also identifies that there are hot springs in the area. Near where they are mapped currently (Eleshkirt), I cannot find any hot springs nearby, but there are some within ~100km. That’s not to say it’s impossible, but hot springs form, shift, and dry at geological time scales, so whatever hot springs Xenophon encountered have a high chance of existing today
          * The closest famous hot springs nearby are in Erzurum (120km away) and Diyadin (99km away), so it’s likely Xenophon passed by these areas, meaning this and surrounding route segments require some rerouting
          * Hot springs could’ve existed at one time and since dried up, either due to geological activity (not likely) or recent human developments (more probable, but I don’t know if I’d consider it likely. It would depend heavily on what’s going on in this local area [depletion of groundwater, intentional elimination, etc.])
          * There could be smaller hot springs out there that I just can’t find online (possible, but I have no way of knowing)
          * The villages here are said to be underground, but I can’t find any evidence of underground habitation in this region, Erzurum nor Ağrı
               * Could be that the famous underground settlements in Cappadocia, Turkey, are also polluting my search results
               * Paradeisopoulos argues that the yearly temperatures in Erzurum justify underground living (at least in winter) (Chronology Model 659), but does not give any explicit archaeological evidence or sites
               * However, yearly temperatures in Eleshkirt and Ağrı are basically the same as Erzurum too, with still no explicit underground habitation evidence 
* 4.5.9 village(?) to 4.6.2 stopping point(?)
     * 3 stages implied. This section is where Xenophon's distances get really wonky. Needs to be revised/refined
* 4.6.2 stopping point(?) to "Phasis" river stopping point(?)
     * Commonly agreed that Xenophon has misidentified the Aras/Araxes as the Phasis
     * 7 stages (~189km) is a crazy long distance that is difficult to reconcile with the geography
          * Some scholars argue that this passage (and many of the ones following this until Gymnias) are intentionally vague/difficult to reconcile because Xenophon may intentionally be covering up how lost they are
     * There’s also significant arguments about whether or not Xenophon marched 7 stages to the “Phasis” and crossed it or whether he marched along it, for how long, etc.
          * My thinking (which is shared by some scholars in this field) is that the Ten Thousand, under the impression that the Aras/Araxes is the Phasis, would following it downstream for at least a bit, hoping it empties into the Black Sea, but would cross after realizing their mistakeG
          * Given that the next journey segment describes a march of 2 stadia/10 parasangs to a crossing that leads to a plain, and the Aras flows into a plain after its currently mountainous region, I went with the idea that they would follow it for that segment
               * However, for the route I have mapped thus far, there is no easy way for them to journey through the mountains, reach the Aras with exactly 2 stages until the intended crossing, and without doubling back on where they were last segment (which I have tried to avoid unless explicitly stated)
                    * It is possible that Xenophon conceals that the Ten Thousand revisited their previous steps, but that falls under speculation, and the goal of the project at this stage is to establish a baseline, i.e. taking Xenophon for his word
               * So, as it stands, they follow the Aras for a little under 30km (about a stage) longer than I would like them to, which may signify that this segment/previous segments need to be recharted
               * However, a winding trek through the mountains like I’ve plotted lines up decently well with the measurements Xenophon gives (about 10km short of my baseline parasang length estimates, but lining up with a more conservative length measurement)
* "Phasis" river stopping point(?) to 4.6.5 plains crossing(?)
     * Slightly inside radius, but intentionally mapped to line up with distance given winding route. Specific crossing is up for debate, but given context (check previous notes) this seems likely
     * Pinning down the mountain pass they encounter is tricky, but there’s some clues:
          * A modern day dam is on the Aras, meaning it was likely wider towards where it flows into the plains that it is now, meaning the Ten Thousand would’ve taken a slightly wider route through the piedmont than what is possible now
          * Xenophon describes the mountain as “about 60 stadia” long (~11km), but accessible enough to pasture animals and therefore accommodate the Ten Thousand’s pack animals
          * Modern Tuzluca sits at a mountain pass just over 2km from the ancient banks of the Aras, is about 11km long, and is tall enough to act as an obstacle and defensive barrier, but not so tall as to be insurmountable by animals or people. Therefore, it is likely that this pass is where the battle starting at 4.6.6 occurred
* 4.6.5 mountain pass(?) to 4.6.27 villages(?)
     * This day was mostly occupied by the fight for the mountain pass. I made it a separate segment, but didn't use a day's march radius since Xenophon's account makes it seem like they only traversed through the pass to the plains this day

## Book 4 (3rd DRAFT NOTES)
* 4.3.1 villages(?) to 4.4.2 village(?)
     * 5 parasangs seems a bit long since that’s a full day’s march and they say they only started at midday, but still plausible
     * Xenophon describes terrain as flat and pleasant, so that could help with their speed. Terrain doesn't actually look that flat, though compared to Karduchoi it certainly is
     * Some scholars argue they go north after their crossing, but that doesn’t seem as likely to me due to how Xenophon describes terrain
          * The closest flat and level terrain is to their west, so I mapped them there
     * Can’t find any archaeological sites identified with the palace of the satrap Xenophon mentions, but their stated measurements puts them between modern-day Kayabağlar and Kurtalan
* 4.4.2 villages(?) to "Tigris headwaters"(?)
     * Physically impossible for them to hit what is, by modern day standards, the actual Tigris headwaters (Lake Harpazus)
          * However, there are many rivers and streams that empty into the Tigris in this region (Mansur Creek, Yanarsu Stream, Kulp Çay, Batman Çay, etc.) that are likely what Xenophon collectively labels as “Tigris headwaters”
* "Tigris headwaters"(?) to 4.4.3 Teleboas villages(?)
      * There are only two routes through this section of the anti-Taurus/Zagros mountain range:
      * **1) Up the Kulp Çay:** This pass is my pick for mapping. They would follow the Kulp Çay through most of the mountains, breaking away from it at a bend, then exiting the mountain range southwest of the Teleboas (Karasu) and modern-day Muș
     * Cons:
          * Xenophon does not explicitly say they follow the “Tigris headwaters” up-stream
          * The actual path overshoots their stated measurements (15 parasangs, ~81km) by about 10km, though more liberal estimates of a parasang shorten, but don’t eliminate, this gap
          * It’s debatable if there was a road here (however, there’s no good archaeological record of routes anywhere in this region)
      * **1) Roman Road/Modern Baykan:** This route posits that Xenophon took the eastern pass through the mountains, exiting near the banks of Lake Van, then following the Teleboas (Karasu) to the Muș region
     * Cons:
          * Xenophon would still have to follow a river (modern Bitlis Stream), which he does not explicitly state
          * Xenophon does not state he marches along the Teleboas any length, and given he describes the river as shallow, it seems there’s no obstacle crossing it. Therefore, it’s unclear why he would march west to Muș at all
          * The distances to Muș still overshoot my working estimates of a parasang (but just barely fall within range of a liberal estimate), but if he didn’t march to Muș the distance is too short
          * While there is evidence of a later Roman road following this pass, and there is a precedent that Roman roads were built on older routes, there’s still no decisive evidence of a road here
     * Teleboas is commonly considered the Karasu River, aka the Western Euphrates. However, it is physically impossible to reach that river. Scholars have argued that other scholars misidentified the Karasu River with Karasu Stream, which is in this area, and in an attempt to reconcile that identify the Teleboas as the Murat Su, which Karasu Stream flows into

### Northeast Route - Murat Su
* Teleboas villages(?) to 4.4.7 palace and villages(?)
     * This path assumes that the Murat Su is what Xenophon meant by the “Euphrates headwaters”, therefore taking him in a northwestern direction
     * Unclear why they would go this way given the caravan route that goes northward
     * Terrain lines up with description as level, but not much at all with mountain passes
          * There is a mountain (Mount Top) that is a bit more than a day’s travel from where they are, so if you squint it works with the text in this section (4.4.15)
          * However, the text describes not one mountain but mountains, and also that Tiribazus was planning to seize the only pass through it. Mount Top does not have a pass through it, and even if it did it’s unclear why Xenophon would need to take it instead of simply going around it
               * It could mean that Tiribazus was planning to seize the pass between the Mt Top and the Murat Su, but that doesn’t line up with the description Xenophon gives
* 4.4.7 palace and villages(?) to 4.5.1 stopping point(?)
     * No specific measurements, just that by the end of a day’s march they passed the summit where Tiribazus was planning to attack them and set up camp
     * The distance is longer than what a full day’s march allows, given a fast pace (which Xenophon implies they took), the low degree of accuracy of given measurements, and a liberal estimate, it barely fits if you squint at it
          * I also intentionally plotted them longer because I put them just after the closest thing that could be considered a mountain pass
* 4.5.1 stopping point(?) to 4.5.2 “Euphrates” crossing(?)
     * Translation says they “traveled through desert terrain,” but looking at the terrain it doesn’t seem much like desert
          * Xenophon uses ἐρήμους (same way he denotes “desert stages” like 2.4.27), so it could be more accurate to say the country is lonely or desolate, which makes sense given the heavy snowfall they just had
     * A later Roman road goes through this region and, given the scholarly precedent for those roads being built on earlier routes, I mapped them across it. Also, it basically takes them on the same route I would have anyway because it’s the path of least resistance in the region
* 4.5.2 “Euphrates” crossing(?) to 4.5.5 stopping place(?)
     * The original Greek in this section says they traveled 15 parasangs, which lines up with the 5 parasangs a day rate, but Xenophon says the third stage was particularly difficult and they made less progress than they would normally. The Carleton-Lewis Brownson translation changes the 15 to 13, presumably to reflect these difficulties
          * This measurement doesn’t fit this route well anyway so it’s not a big deal, but good to keep in mind for evidence against this route
     * 3 stages is way too long for this route, but they are near modern Diyadin, which is famous for hot springs, which fits with the description in the next segment
* 4.5.5 stopping place(?) to 4.5.9 village(?)
     * 1 day’s march just barely fits, given the previous measurement was way shorter than stated, but it’s plausible that they traveled much slower due to snow and fatigue
     * Xenophon mentions hot springs in this section and one of the two areas famous for them in Eastern Turkey is just south of Diyadin, so I mapped them through the geologically active areas
     * They would be tailing, and sometimes crossing, the Murat Su, but Xenophon doesn’t mention that
          * Combination of the snow, dry season, freezing temps, and headwaters of the river may have rendered it noticeable or a nonentity to the Ten Thousand
### Murat Su; Seven stages to Aras
* 4.5.9 village(?) to 4.6.2 stopping point(?)
     * 3 stages is implied (4.6.2)
     * On this route they cut through and circle Hüdavendigar Dağı because:
          * A winding path lines up with the distance better and
          * Xenophon states that Cheirisophus was mad because their guide was not leading them to other villages because there were none in the region
               * It’s possible the guide was intentionally avoiding other villages because his own was not treated ideally by the Ten Thousand
                    * Also the fact that he ran away implies he was at least somewhat confident in his ability to return home\
               * Winding through steep, rugged mountain passes seems like terrain least hospitable to villages
                    * Even if there were other villages, the narrow route would ensure that the Ten Thousand can’t get a good view of the terrain
               * Being south of Hüdavendigar Dağı lines them up best for a 7 day march to the Aras
     * I have them end on another Roman road partially because the the precedent established earlier and partially because it’s built on the easiest and fastest terrain, so even if there was no route here it’s still the most logical path
     * They would have to pass by a few rivers (most notably Ilica Stream) that Xenophon does not mention\
          * Possible the the snow, dry season, freezing temps, and headwaters of the river may have rendered it noticeable or a unworthy of mention
          * Could also be Xenophon intentionally doesn’t mention them as a later editorial choice to conceal how lost they are
* 4.6.2 stopping point(?) to "Phasis" river(?)
     * Distance lines up pretty well
     * They loop back on themselves near moder Hamur (or near modern Aşaǧı Köşkköy or if they strictly follow the Roman road, but that overshoots their distance by ~20km; as currently mapped, however, without guides it’s unclear how they know of the shortest route, as Xenophon does not state any specific plan) which Xenophon does not explicitly mention
          * Could that he purposely does not mention it, perhaps to conceal how lost they really are
     * I have them reaching the Aras ~3km east of modern Horasan, but could realistically be anywhere on the stretch between Horasan and ~3km east of modern Çiftlik without mucking up the measured distance too much\
     * Xenophon does not mention Karapir Creek that they would’ve likely encountered, but it’s a vague passage and all of the previous combination of reasons discussed for other rivers explain this instance too
