### Introduction... 

The edition used for the _Periplus of the Erythraean Sea_ is the most recent edition by Stefano Belfiore for the _New Jacoby_ (Fr. 2036), which is based substantially on the established critical text by Frisk (1927), with some updates. The digital text is the one published in the online edition of the _New Jacoby_, cleaned, formatted, and inspected for mistakes. All footnotes and apparatus criticus have been removed. 

Additionally, the text has been processed for Named Entity Recognition using the UGARIT NER model for Ancient Greek (https://huggingface.co/UGARIT/grc-ner-bert). The annotations were cleaned and disambiguated manually.
