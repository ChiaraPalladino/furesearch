# Mapping Commentary (and Points for Review)
### This is an aggregate of all of my commentary in mapping the _Anabasis_, similar to my notable annotations and commentary list, mostly so that it's on record. **Partway through I swap from 1st draft to 2nd draft notes!** So keep an eye out for that.
Also, here's a cheat sheet for the measurements Xenophon uses. They are all not exactly known in the modern day, and even back then they were variable, meaning that they weren't concrete distances but more often how long it took to get somewhere, but it's the best he gives us. When interpreting these measurements, I use a range of values.
* _Stadion_
    * Not precisely known
    * 1 stadion = ~184m (150-210m)
* _Parasang_
    * Not precisely know; a measure of walking distance; potentially based on how far a soldier could march a day
    * 1 parasang = ~30 stadia
    * 1 parasang = ~5.4km (4.7-5.6km)
* _Stage_
    * Not precisely known; really only shows up in Xenophon’s Anabasis
    * There’s also desert stages too? Implying that a stage could also be a relative measure of marching distance, like parasang, that would be impacted by terrain
    * 1 stage = 160 stadia
    * 1 stage = ~29.8km (24-33.6km)

## Book 2 (1st DRAFT NOTES)
* I’m having Book 2 start at the reference point Pleiades gives for the wall of Media (33.1216, 44.2698) and not where Wikipedia roughly lists the Battle of Cunaxa as having occurred (33.325, 44.08) because:
    * It’s where I left off in book 1
    * **The Pleiades reference point is not actually the Median Wall**, but the defensive ditch Artaxerxes II carved that reaches to it, that Pleiades labels the Wall of Media. The actual Median Wall may be a bit further south/southeast, since it’s only said to be “where the length between the Tigris and Euphrates narrows considerably”
* The Battle of Cunaxa is stated to have happened on the left bank of the Euphrates, yet the coords for it place it almost directly between the Tigris and Euphrates
    * Towards the beginning of book 2, Xenophon states that the journey from Ephesus to the battlefield  has been 93 stages/535 parasangs/16,050 stadia, and from the battlefield to Babylon is 360 stadia
        * Now stadia nor parasangs nor stages are precise measurements that we can directly calculate to the modern day, BUT if we work within a range of values (1 parasang = 4.7-5.6km) (1 stadion = 150-210m) (1 stage=29.8km), this area seems reasonable. From this battlefield point, the center of Babylon is ~66.45km away, which is already within the range given, not accounting for whether it was measured from the battlefield to the city walls or city center, how big and where the battlefield was, etc., which are accommodated to a reasonable extent
    * HOWEVER, in Book 1 they don’t actually reach the Wall of Media itself, but a defensive canal dug near it
    * Furthermore, in Book 2 it’s implied they travel at least a little bit until they reach the Wall of Media
    * MY CURRENT THEORY is that the Pleiades point for the Wall of Media is part of the defensive canal that flows northwest to southeast, semi-parallel to the Euphrates (since it’s said it empties into the Euphrates, or at the very least gets very close, creating a passage only about 20 (greek?) feet in width) 
        * In Book 1 Cyrus is said to have traveled for 3 days, growing more lax in defense each day, but no measurements are given until well after he’s dead, when Artaxerxes II’s troops storm Cyrus’ and Ariaeus’ camp, and the soldiers retreat to their setting-off point earlier in the day (which was about 4 parasangs away)
        * Given that he was likely marching towards Babylon, they probably traveled south from the Pleiades Wall of Media reference point, fought near the bend in the Euphrates where the Median Wall may actually be (or at least before the space between the Euphrates and Tigris widens again), then the soldiers backtracked and fled up ~4 parasangs
         * Given all that, they potentially backtracked back to the reference point, so I will be starting Book 2 from this reference point
* Given the almost contemporary status of Xenophon and Herodotus, the two Greek authors to earliest and widely make use of parasangs in their writings, and given the pre existing scholarship on the topic **(Rood, T. (2010). _Xenophon's parasangs._ https://doi.org/10.1017/s0075426910000042)**, I’m going to go with the idea that parasangs are variable, and I am going to borrow Herodotus’ assertion that an “army moves [roughy] 5 parasangs per day” when trying to calculate distances where Xenophon measures in days (such as the beginning of book 2)
    * Applies to 2.2.13 march
    * For 2.3.14 guided march, no days nor distance is given, so I’m assuming half a day at most, though it could be less because maybe Xenophon didn’t think it was enough to merit measurements
        * Also the direction is up in the air. Since they have to eventually get to Opis, and the king is guiding them and is based out of Babylon, south/southeast felt like a solid guess
* From the 2.3.14 villages they encounter the actual Median Wall after marching 3 stages. Even with the most conservative measure of distance, this is an absurdly huge zone. Even if my previous estimations (where they first encountered the trench, the battlefield location, their falling back point) are, which to an extent they no-doubt are, they would have to be wrong by such a wide margin that it contradicts measurements Xenophon previously gave. Maybe an instance of Xenophon forgot?
    * Now here’s a thought. Xenophon says it’s “not too far distant from Babylon” (2.4.12), and there are so many different rivers and tributaries in this area. The Wall is said to be built at a narrowing of the Tigris and Euphrates, but where this area would seem to be doesn’t make sense geographically. However, if it was between two tributaries of the Tigris and Euphrates, or rivers that were mistaken as the two, it could be much closer to Babylon and potentially line up with the measurements more.
        * Highly unlikely that people have been misidentifying the location for ~2500 years, and this thought fully comes from trying to treat subjective measurements as objective, but I’m coping okay
* The measurements here are all sorts of wonky. This part actually lines up reasonably with where I put the Median Wall, and therefore where they would’ve passed inside, but that also contradicts the measurements given before and after
* Where I estimated Sittace to be on the map that makes sense with Xenophon’s journey measurements, the fact that they haven’t crossed the Tigris yet (ie on the Babylon side), and 15 stadia (2.25km) from the river
    * HOWEVER, that’s not particularly in the bounds of Sittacene as it’s represented on Pleiades, so who knows, this whole section is going to have to be heavily reviewed anyway
* The measurements Xenophon gives from Sittace to Opis all like eight degrees of wonked, and there’s just no way they work geographically. I desperately need to review and basically redo this entire section, since right now the only possible way it works is: Opis is misidentified (either by Xenophon or modern day scholars), all the preceding measurements are wrong, or Xenophon is extremely wrong right now
* Distance from Opis to “villages of Parysatis” (2.4.27) lines up refreshingly well. If anything, it might be a bit short (potentially due to “desert stages”; I assume they can cover greater distances on flat desert terrain?)
    * Nevermind it actually might be nowhere near long enough, because immediately after it says they pass by Cenae in the first stage of their 4 desert stage march, and where these villages are estimated right now they can barely even reach Cenae by the end of the march
* As it stands, they have to get to the Zapatas river (2.5.1) by the end of Book 2, so measurements be damned I put them there

## Book 3 (1st DRAFT NOTES)
* Where exactly they crossed the Zapatas (3.3.6) is up for debate
    * The wording in 3.4.6 implies that they weren’t already following the Tigris when they crossed the Zapatas, so they may have crossed it’s headwaters further up then went northwest at a diagonal, reaching the Tigris and Larisa
* No distance measurements are given from 3.3.11 onward to Larisa. For my estimations right now, they only would’ve marched just over 9km, which seems short given that they could likely cover 27km a day
    * They did have a skirmish with Persian troops, and spend time crossing a gorge, so it’s likely they wouldn’t be traveling 27km this day, but it could reasonably be more than 9, supporting that they crossed the Zapatas not as close to the Tigris
* The actual distance from Larisa to Mespila isn’t completely accurate with Xenophon’s measurements, but only by a few km. Also doesn’t explicitly mention crossing the Tigris, even though he would have to
    * Could also be a measurement error with my projection system
* At 3.4.18, they’re said to have marched a day with no destination, distance measurements, or any further elaboration given. Currently assuming this is at a normal pace (5 parasangs/day), and is separate from a measurement of 4 stages they’re said to have traveled in 3.4.23

## Book 4 (1st DRAFT NOTES)
* I’ve come to the conclusion that I think I’ve been completely wrong on this first draft of mapping
    * Given this, I’ve decided to continue on as if this was correct, then probably just redo the whole thing
    * They in fact have not crossed the Tigris at all, and I think that’s where I went wrong

# Here's Where I do-over: 
### The next notes are formatted more concisely. Some are copy-pasted from the original 1st draft becasue they're the same issues, but there's also additional commentary.

## Book 2 (2nd DRAFT NOTES)
* (2.4.27) Opis to villages of Parysatis(?)
    * The distance actually seems way too short given that he says his next journey passes by Cenae in the first stage, while with current measurements he could barely reach it by the end of the 4th stage
         * It could be that either Cenae and Opis are misidentified. However, Pleiades’ certainty rating is “certain” for both. Of the two, Opis seems more likely that it would be wrong though because the measurements going into and coming out of it don’t line up, nor does it’s position in relation to the Physcus river. 	One source (Mason, Kenneth. “Notes on the Canal System and Ancient Sites of Babylonia in the Time of Xenophon.” The Geographical Journal 56, no. 6 (1920): 468–81. https://doi.org/10.2307/1780469.) says it’s under or immediately north of the ruins of Aski Baghdad, but I can find zero accurate coordinates that line up with where that is
             * Now that I’m looking at it closer, the Physcus river doesn’t seem to be accurate at all. It’s identified with the Tornadotus on wikipedia, however Pleiades instead links it to the Diyala river, but that location still seems off relative to Opis
             * Looking at it, there seems to be a river that is just not identified (right now tentatively Tornadotus/Phsycus) near where Opis Diabas/Turnat reference points are, then above that should be the Diyala, then the Lesser Zab, then the Great Zab
             * Further evidence that there’s something up with the identification of Tornadotus vs Physcus vs Diyala is that Xenophon never says they cross another river before reaching the villages of Parysatis, where they should at least be crossing the Diyala
* (2.4.28) Villages of Parysatis(?) to Cenae and Zapatas river
    * Further evidence that there’s something up with the identification of Tornadotus vs Physcus vs Diyala is that Xenophon never says they cross another river before reaching the Zapatas, where they should at least be crossing Diyala to get to the villages of Parysatis, and the Little Zab to get to Cenae
    * Can never rule out that Xenophon simply forgot, but the Little Zab especially seems bigger than the Phycus, which seems worthy of a mention
        * Have to check the calendar, but they may have been traveling in winter, aka dry season, so the rivers would’ve been much less
* (3.3.11) Zapatas crossing
    * Still unclear on if they crossed the Zapatas close to the tigris or not. No evidence they didn’t, but if they did, they should be able to travel further in the next segment, unless the skirmish really took a long time

## Book 3 (2nd DRAFT NOTES)
* (3.4.1) Gorge and Persian skirmish to Larisa
    * Can’t find any geographic equivalent nearby of where this gorge might be
    * Also, unless the skirmish took a really long time, which it doesn’t seem like it did and rather Xenophon describes it as if the Greeks made short work of the Persians, they should be able to travel much further than Larisa
* (3.4.10) Larisa to Mespila
    * The distance lines up perfectly with the range of values given. The only problem is that the Mespila reference point is on the opposite side of the Tigris, and they haven't crossed yet (made the mistake of mapping it like they had before)
* (3.4.16) Mespila to 3.4.18 villages(?)
    *  No direction given; assuming they followed the Tigris
* 3.4.18 villages(?) to 3.4.19 stopping point(?)
    * No direction, destination, or distance measurements given. Assuming they followed the Tigris still. The ArcGIS basemap shows a lake as part of the Tigris, but the CAWM doesn't, only showing a basin; traced around it as if lake; doesn't effect journey
    * 1 day’s march at 27km seems excessive for this region, even though it lines up (or in some cases is even smaller) than typical historical figures 
* (3.4.28) 4 stages from 3.4.18 stopping point
    * No direction or much elaboration given. They actually proceed five stages, but the action picks up midway throught their fifth stage, so I made it a separate segment
    * 4 stages at ~30km a stage seems extremely excessive for this region, because if they traveled 120km they'd be right in the middle of Karduchoi here. Even with a windy path and mountainous terrain, there’s only so much that can be done
    * There’s also no mention of them crossing or even encountering the Little Khabur that flows into the Tigris. They could’ve gone around it, but that doesn’t explain why Xenophon didn’t mention it
    * Also the action cuts back in in the middle of the fifth stage near a mountain crossing, and I cannot figure out where that is. There’s more mountains here than Xenophon seems to have recognized
        * At first glance, and with the distances still to go, it would seem to be the range just south of the Khabur Tigris that pulls in close to the Tigris river, then they stomp around that river valley north for a bit before resolving to go into the Carduchian mountains
        * There’s a path further north, but it’s basically at the entrance to the Carduchian mountains, so that seems like it’d be later, even though it’s closer to the measurement distance Xenophon gives here
            * This actually might be it, and Karduchoi is further north than I thought
                * Nevermind, doesn’t line up with when they claim they can no longer follow the Tigris, nor with the terrain description of them still being in plains
    * I think I’m gonna bite the bullet, say Xenophon screwed up his measurements, and keep going
* (3.4.24) March through fifth stage
    * This also again seems exceptionally long. They did skirmish with the Persians here, but it doesn’t seem like it was enough to slow their progress.
        * Running into major problems where Xenophon's measurements drastically overshoot the geographic space
    * Still, given the skirmish, hill terrain, and need for more space, I put them slightly within the radius of a conservative estimate of day’s travel
    * Also says for their next leg the descend into the plain, so for this I put them partially up a mountain
