## Aristophanes' Wasps - documentation on specific decisions

**Add appropriate references here, like the commentaries you drew upon to make sense of the jokes. Adding them upfront will spare the time of referencing them throughout.**

#### ll. 10-13. **Copypaste the text of the joke in question (Greek and Translation)**
* **Context:** **Provide the essential context of the joke - pretend the reader does not have the spreadsheet in front of them.**  
* **Explanation:** **(Who? the joke? a character?)** pokes fun at the Medians, which would have been seen negatively (hence "hostile” in translation). Use of “Medos” demonstrates the aggression with which the sleep came for Xanthias **(this sentence is unclear)**. In general, Eastern people are viewed negatively in the 5th century BCE, due to the ongoing Persian Wars between Greeks and Persians.
* **Predominant sentiment:** However, this joke is intended to have a positive reaction from the character Sosias **(WHY?)**, so mixed sentiment. 

#### ll. 16-19. **Copypaste the text of the joke in question (Greek and Translation)**
* **Context:** A hip political joke. Draws upon negative associations with Cleonymus (dropping shield in battle and fleeing) to make the joke. Referencing the shield seems strange at first, until Cleonymus is used as the punchline. (Perhaps meant to reference/honor Zeus or at least compare the two with the eagle picking up the shield?) The eagle is used to belittle Cleonymus’ image as it is shown having more “honor” than him.

#### ll. 31-36 
* **Context:** The Pnyx was a hill used by people for meetings and speeches, etc.
* **Explanation:** The joke is meant to draw similarities between what the animals were doing and human activities, so basically calling the humans sheep and whales. (**who??** it is portrayed as uncivilized/not respected because **aristophanes?** he is describing animals doing it, when people do the same) The image of animals on this platform is intended to be ridiculous. “Rapacious” (greedy) is how πανδοκεύτρια is translated. Πανδοκεύτρια means “hostess” but it is translated figuratively as “accepting all.”

#### ll. 48-51 
* Theorus is clearly disliked, probably because of his associations with Kleon. Mixed sentiment because being with the crows is negative, but given that the characters dislike Theorus, it is presented as a positive. A sort of punishment for whatever wrong he apparently did.

#### ll. 150-151
A pun. Capnius means smoky (κάπνιον = smoke) and is the nickname of another playwright, Ecphantides, who was disliked by writers at the time. It is implying that Ecphantides smelled bad, as he is related to the smoke of fig-wood, “the most acrid of all.”
-
#### ll. 169-171
Philocleon is frustrated.
-
#### ll. 187-189
A couple of insults.
#### ll. 193-195
Claiming he is rich.
-
#### ll. 207-210
Scione was lost by the Athenians to the Spartans in the Pel. war, 223 BC. Fun is heightened because they would catch this man with a sparrow net, but it is inside, so instead they use their voices, as if he really were a bird.
#### ll. 211-213
Slight negative sentiment to make audience empathize with the slaves, but not enough to make the whole sentence classified as negative. Mostly neutral because it is a simple question. The positive is presented first, then the negative sentiment where we are reminded of their drowsiness.
#### ll. 217-221
Phrynichus was a poet/playwright. Most of his work has been lost, so this may refer to something that happened in a play of his.
#### ll. 223-227
These people are portrayed negatively by calling them wasps and accompanying that word with various other negative traits wasps have, and expressing fear surrounding them.
#### ll. 251-253
Joke focused on oil scarcity after being destroyed by Spartan invasions.
#### ll. 254-257
Compares them to an animal. πηλὸν (mud) mentioned to degrade them.
#### ll. 293-296
Shows how poor the man is, as he mentions buying knucklebones as a favor for the son (who asked for something nice), which would have been super cheap. Contains an affirmative and a positive adjective.
#### ll. 303-308
Again, bringing up how poor they are to be funny (the fact that they are relying on an event that is not guaranteed to happen to pay for their dinner). Hypothetically the thing he will offer for dinner is “helles sacred waves,” or unattainable resources.
340 Κακόν, even though it means “bad,” does not really contribute to the sentiment. It contributes more to the fun score because it is used sort of in a double-negative way, where he is unable to inflict bad things upon other people, which is portrayed as bad in itself by the way he speaks. Fun is higher because he speaks negatively of good things, like enjoying himself
#### ll. 341-345
Μιαρὸς means “stained.” Δημολογοκλέων is the first part of Bdelycleon's name replaced with "demologos" which means politician (negatively), so the speaker is accusing him of locking Philocleon up because he has secret political reasons. Part of the fun score too because it is a unique name to call someone that would only suit this particular situation. ξυνωμότης means “conspirator,” which means it is fun for the same reason demologocleon is – it accuses Bdelycleon of working with others to keep his father from ruining something political for him.
-
#### ll. 348-349
Philocleon speaks highly about what he wants to do, but expresses that he does not have much hope.
#### ll. 350-351
Hopeful.
#### ll. 352-353
Ouk = not, so a negative. The sentence itself shows a negative outlook on what they are trying to do. A pun is present with the word ὀπίαν, meaning “cheese” (a certain type that is made with fig-juice). Ὀπίαν is like ope which means hole, and the sentence uses ὀπίαν as if it means hole itself.
#### ll. 354-355
The taking of Naxos happened in 470, so this would be around fifty years difference. Meaning he is quite old, so this could just be poking fun at that.
#### ll. 356-357
Continuing the age joke.
#### ll. 358-364
The men are not at arms, because they do not have weapons. They are also, as said before, on the verge of sleep and very reluctant to be guarding. So this is Bdelycleon exaggerating his dire circumstances. Compares himself to a naughty ferret as well (translated as cat, but technically means pole-cat. Greeks kept them around to take care of mice).
-
#### ll. 379-380
Διοπείθους - a politician generally regarded as not sane, so using his name as a role model is another poke at how strange these men are. His name means “trust in Zeus” which could also be part of why it is used here.
#### ll. 383-384
Fun part is the old men stroking their ego about their strength, when they probably would not have much. They refer to themselves as trees to paint their strength positively.
#### ll. 385-386
Common for people to instruct what to do with their body if they are close to death. 1, he has been reassured that he is not close to death so this is him being dramatic. He even checks to see if they are listening to his last wishes. 2, to wish to be buried in a court is absurd and plays on how obsessed these people are with the law. Positive because he notes how he trusts his friends and it is implied that the risk to his life will be worth it to him. Negative because he is worried he will die. So, mixed.
#### ll. 398-399
Negative sentiment, but 0 fun I think because the words themselves do not particularly exhibit much fun. It would be the actions that contribute to the fun, which is not present in a written version.
#### ll. 400-402
Smicythion, Tisiades, Chremon and Pheredipnus are most likely politicians names that were distorted. Tisiades cannot be traced, but Smicythion could reference the secretary to the board of control. Chremon (needy) = Chromon, Pheredipnus (winner of dinner) = Pherenicus.
#### ll. 418-419
Irony. The chorus worships the court system and prosecutors, so they appeal to these people rather than gods for help.  This would mean they don’t like the gods and the word θεοισεχθρία (hatefulness to the gods) is presented positively, which is meant to shock the audience because Aristophanes obviously knows it would not be seen positively. They do not say “my gods,” but rather refer to people who detest the gods (Theoi means “my gods,” which is how the word starts).
#### ll. 422-425
Fun is contained in the physical side of comedy. But also the aspect of these men ready to kill to let this jailed man vote adds to the comedy. Ὀργίζω (to irritate) aids the negative sentiment as a verb.
#### ll. 430-432
Πρωκτός - anus. Calling this area specifically to stab someone adds to fun score because it is crude. These men refer to themselves as σφῆκες positively and the speaker sounds encouraging.
#### ll. 433-436
Lots of slaves came from Phrygia. So these are nicknames for slaves: Μίδα (Midas was a king of Phrygia) and Φρὺξ (Phyrgia made into a name). Μασιντύα is also a nickname for slaves but is not related to Phrygia (greedy feeder). “I have often heard the crackling of fig-leaves in the fire” – they are all talk, so do not fear them.
#### ll. 438-440
Kekrops - politician (well-known king of Athens). Irony present where he is wondering why his son would treat him this way and reflects upon the negative part of parenting as if it were something his son should be happy about.
#### ll. 448-452
This is directed to a slave. Irony again. He speaks positively, but nothing he says is good.
#### ll. 453-455
Ὀξύθυμος is “quick to anger”, obviously a negative adjective. κάρδαμον is a strong-smelling seed like mustard. To compare themselves to this is to call themselves unpleasant to deal with, thus it is negative. 
#### ll. 461-462
Philocles had a pointy head. He is saying that they would have fought better if they were like Philocles.
#### ll. 463-470
A big part of the humor of the chorus seems to be them dramatizing the scenarios and their importance in the court. Bdelycleon is attempting to bring an end to democracy with his selfish ways. He is called κομηταμυνία ( long-haired Amynias), suggesting that he is Spartan (this took place in Athens during the Peloponnesian War so that is an insult), anti-democratic, and arrogant.
#### ll. 474-476
Using ἄκουρος (unshaven) as a link to his supposed Spartan allies is meant to be comical because plenty of older Athenians would have been unshaven as well, so the comedy is the chorus grasping at straws. Insinuate he is tied to Brasidas, a Spartan general. Μισόδημος (hating the commons) insults how he apparently has no care for democracy and their rights as Athenians.
#### ll. 477-478
Usually it would be a parent separating from a child, but here we see expectations subverted for a comedic effect. This action would be seen as improper because he nis an only child and thus would leave his father with no one to care for him. The concept itself is what makes the fun score and negative sentiment.
#### ll. 480-483
An old saying that we have since lost the meaning and origin of. We can infer that it is saying something along the lines of “if you think you have problems now, just wait!” It is negative sentiment because the chorus is ridiculing Bdelycleon and still accusing him of conspiracy.
-
#### ll. 500-502
Pun. Hippias, which means horsy, was a tyrant. So this is a joke about how he wanted the prostitute to get on top (ride him like a horse), and her calling this tyrannical. The fact that it is a prostitute adds to the joke because in theory, she would not get much respect from patrons in the first place, so it just adds to the ridiculous behavior they are talking about. To be quick to anger is clearly a negative trait, or else it would not be shared in this scenario.
#### ll. 503-507
Negative because he is wishing for his father to listen to him. Positive because he speaks nicely of this lifestyle. Ὀρθροφοιτοσυκοφαντοδικοταλαίπωροι is a compound (early-prowling base-informing sad-litigious plaguy) that is full of negative sentiment. However, because it may not be a typical word, it contributes more to fun score. Morychus was a lover of food, so to wish for his father to be like him is to wish for him to accept a more simple and pleasurable life.
#### ll. 508-511
He is speaking highly of his desired life, while describing things that are typically regarded as the finer things in life to be negative. 
-
#### ll. 518-520
It’s possible that this is a quote from Kleon. Also references how other cities were made to give money to Athens as a tribute. A tribute which Philocleon gets none of, as Bdelycleon points out, despite all he does for the city. 
-
#### ll. 531-536
Straightforward language. Sentiment is negative because of the way the speaker describes the event.
#### ll. 540-545
Θαλλοφόρος - bearers of an olive branch in the Panathenaea had to be very old but they were chosen for their handsomeness. Could be a joke about how they find themselves handsome enough to be chosen, but definitely a negative way to call themselves old. Σκώπτω means “mock” which I believe to be negative as mocking is not done positively, but rather to degrade.
#### ll. 576-577
Here Bdelycleon is poking fun at how his father claims that he can “disdain wealth,” which would have been seen as funny because with wealth would come a lot of privileges. Καταχήνη (mockery) is translated as “disdain” so it contributes to sentiment.
#### ll. 621-630
Σεμνόω means to exalt, which would be a positive sentiment. In this line, the speaker speaks highly of himself by describing how others react to him. So although fear would be negative, it is used positively here.
#### ll. 636-641
Large exaggeration contributes to fun score, as well as the implication that the happiest afterlife attainable (to them) is to still be judging, but in the Isles of the Blest, the Greek paradise. He is showering compliments about the speech, so positive sentiment. Μάκαρ - Blessed.
-
#### ll. 648-649
Metaphor to describe how Bdelycleon’s arguments must be in order to beat Philocleon’s. It must act like a millstone to soften the chorus’ sharp prejudice.
#### ll. 650-652
This translation does not include Bdelycleon calling his father the "son of Kronus (Κρονίδης)," which is important because it is an attempt to appeal emotionally to a man who believes himself to be on the level of Zeus. It could also be a way to get Zeus’ attention to help. χαλεπός - difficult. Δεινός - fearful, terrible. Νόσος - sickness. All negative language here. Κρονίδης could be seen as negative as he was not a particularly positive role model, but I do not believe it contributes in this way.
#### ll. 653-654
Fun score comes from the fact that he interrupted the line to speak. Also how he told his son not to call him “father.” He threatens to kill him in the same breath and says he would not mind the punishment.
#### ll. 680-681
Eucharides was probably a well-known grocer. Philocleon is poor in contrast with this rich man and he is not given food as compensation. However, he does not recognize this as having proved Bdelycleon’s point, so he urges him to continue. He is relatively neutral in doing so.
#### ll. 696-697
Although Philocleon is feeling negative, this could have a positive sentiment because he starts to come around and realize how he is mistreated. This is also funny because of the contrast of how adamant he had been up until this point.
#### ll. 713-714
Dramatics. He either had a sword held up, or he is referencing how he is losing his “sting” as a wasp. And he is having an existential crisis about the thing he has devoted himself to.
#### ll. 715-718
Bdelycleon revealing the different things Philocleon has fallen for and not realized were tricks.
-
-
#### ll. 729-736
The chorus seems to be admitting that they have a weaker argument here, but they say that it is because of a god, which is why Philocleon should give in and reap the rewards the god has in store. Does not admit that they are actually wrong, but that it would be smarter to listen.
#### ll. 737-742
Mixed because he is describing treating his father well, but then he notices that he seems to still be thinking, which is bad. Fun because Philocleon is implied to be unable to achieve an erection, so the “wench” he would be given would only massage him. Πέος - penile membrane. Ὀσφύς - loin.
#### ll. 743-747
Positive sentiment as the chorus describes Philocleon supposedly coming around to the “right” side. They are complimenting him. Ἄρτιος - Perfect of its kind; suitable. Σωφρονέω - to be of sound mind.
#### ll. 750-759
The logic behind Bdelycleon’s argument does not trump Philocleon’s love for convicting people, so much so that he likes to be the last person to vote so that it takes as long as possible. He describes the act positively to match his yearning. Verb here is “ἐράω” – to love. I would say that is positive sentiment because you do not proclaim love for something in a negative way.
-
#### ll. 777-778
Arist. is trying to make Bdelycleon’s proposal seem enticing by describing the court system negatively. Πεινάω - to hunger. It is used as a downside to going to court.
#### ll. 781-783
He says that eating is a good time to ruminate. Pun is in the word ἀναμασάομαι because of the double-meaning (chew, ruminate).
#### ll. 787-792
Αἰσχρός - causing shame. Σκωπτόλης - jester
#### ll. 799-804
Perhaps was meant to be a joke because that seems like an odd thing for an oracle to predict. It could be him exaggerating the importance of this arrangement.
#### ll. 805-808
He apparently has a weak bladder. A normal courtroom would have required Philocleon, as an old man, to leave multiple times to use the restroom. Adding that it is very near to him places emphasis on this.
-
-
He is speaking of jury service like a religious ceremony. Also he had said earlier that he wished to be buried under the railings, so this is something trivial he cares about. Neutral because it appears he is just making observations.
#### ll. 836-838
Λάβης is the dog’s name, which combines the word “λαβή” (Grabber) and the name of a politician, Λάχης, who allegedly embezzled funds in Sicily, hence the Sicilian cheese being stolen by his dog form. The negative sentiment comes from the fact that this is a complaint and inconvenience.
-
#### ll. 863-867
Expressing gratitude for a positive end to the disagreement they had causes a positive sentiment. Σπονδαῖς has a meaning not listed by PDL which is “peace agreement” which fits here (according to Sommerstein) and has positive sentiment. Ἀγαθός has been listed as positive sentiment in previous sentences as it means “good.”
#### ll. 869-874
The chorus is hoping that this method works so that they may be able to quit the courts themselves and instead stay home. Fun because it is ironic how they wish for the thing they supposedly love so much to end.
#### ll. 885-890
Just a few lines ago, this chorus was saying that Bdelycleon was against the people and democracy, but they have completely changed their tune now. The irony contributes to fun score. They now speak highly of him with a positive sentiment.
-
#### ll. 907-911
The words here create a negative sentiment, as Sosias takes up the role of describing the crime in place of the other dog, who would not speak. Δεινός (fearful, terrible) has a negative sentiment. This whole scene is a reference to Laches crimes in Sicily.
#### ll. 914-916
Again, this line is from the other dog’s perspective, which is why Sosias is complaining that Labes did not split the cheese with him. The other dog probably also resembled a politician (Kleon), which is why he complains only of what he does not get, rather than the crime itself. As it is a complaint, it is negative sentiment.
#### ll. 922-925
The two situations are combined in this sentence with an ambigious metaphor. The verb περιπλέω (sail) has little relevance to the literal situation, but it is intended to reference Laches’ actions again, as he sailed around Sicily. The dog is called a man to further this. He is accused of “chewing up the rind of the city,” which does not make sense on its own. It refers to how Laches ate up the funds of the city, while Labes ate up the cheese and rind in the platter. The use of αὖ (again) appears to be a pun, because it also means “bow-wow” according to PDL. None of these words are outrightly negative on their own, but the whole line is a layered joke, hence the fun score.
#### ll. 927-930
Because the prosecutor dog represents Kleon, he is shown as loud and reveals that he only cares to get rid of this rival. Also, while the word “κλέπτα” (thief) could be used with a negative sentiment, the dog does not say it in this way, but rather self-identifies with it. Κολάζω (punish) is a verb with a negative sentiment. He then goes on to say that since he is speaking up, the “jury” must listen to his point of view or he will never speak up again, or “bark” (presumably, this is not a bad threat because the audience would have wanted Kleon himself to stop talking anyway).
#### ll. 931-935
Roosters do not have opinions on the law, so he is really just putting his all into pretending that this mock-trial is real. He calls out to a (pretend) lawgiver to hand him the chamber-pot, which the audience would find funny as it is strange to ask someone so high up to do such a menial task. Negative sentiment due to how Philocleon is using his words to speak negatively of the dog (πανουργία - knavery).
-
#### ll. 942-944
It is negative because it is somewhat of an accusation. Χαλεπός (difficult) has a negative sentiment itself, and the first part of the line is centered around “difficult” being a bad thing to be.
#### ll. 946-952
Thucydides was banished for ten years and evidently was unable to speak on his own defense for a different charge (maybe because his jaw was locked, or perhaps because he was guilty). This is not the case for the dog, whether it be because he is a dog (which do not talk) or because it is part of the personality Arist. is creating to make him seem more like a politician. 
#### ll. 957-959
Saying that he cannot play the lyre implies that he had a poor upbringing because learning to play the lyre would have been part of his education had he had one, and therefore his crime is a result of his ignorance, thus he cannot be blamed. This is a joke about the politician Laches, as he would have been rich and is said to have been very good with music. Although the words in the latter half of the line seem to be negative, I still think sentiment is positive due to how it evokes pity and puts the “suspect” in a more positive light.
#### ll. 962-965
Another reference to what Laches did in Sicily. Here, Bdelycleon seems to be saying in Laches (Labes) defense that he did what he was supposed to do and used the money (cheese) on the soldiers. Thus, it is the cheese-grater’s (paymaster, or someone who distributes resources) fault for giving the cheese to him in the first place.
#### ll. 967-972
Speaks negatively of the other dog to uplift the image of Labes (typical political talk) and makes Labes’ actions seem like a product of his sad circumstances, hence negative sentiment.
#### ll. 975-978
This parodies what Philocleon was making fun of earlier when men would have their children accompany them to court to make the jury feel pity for his situation and be less harsh.
#### ll. 982-984
Philocleon feels a wave of emotion, which we are to believe is rare (both for him and other Athenian jurors), and likely blames the onions in his food. This defense has brought him to tears.
-
#### ll. 999-1002
Neg sentiment. He seems to be in mourning, probably because this messes with his perfect record of never acquitting anyone. He is acting like showing mercy is the worst thing he could do and the gods will be angry at him for it.
#### ll. 1003-1007
Bdelycleon is clearly trying to keep his father distracted from his addiction by promising fun grown-up activities like he is a child. The humor is in how the son will be treating his father like an adult as a reward.
-
#### ll. 1051-1059
When clothes were not suitable for the season and put in storage, they would be put with dried fruit peels to keep moths and mice away. If you put the poet’s ideas in with the clothes as well, supposedly it will be beneficial. The chorus is trying to be motivational here. They reveal that Aristophanes is not just writing this play for laughs, but so the audience can leave with a message that will impact their lives. 
-
#### ll. 1126-1128
A complaint about what Bdelycleon is trying to force him to wear, so negative sentiment. Plus a funny anecdote that the audience could have related to.
 #### ll. 1145-1147
A talent is about 27 kgs, so Bdelycleon is exaggerating about how much this piece of clothing weighs to make it seem nice.
#### ll. 1177-1178
Obviously not something to say in polite company, and it would be better to speak of real things, as Bdelycleon goes on to point out. Still neutral sentiment, as he clearly sees nothing wrong with it.
#### ll. 1183-1185
Theogenes was a well-known merchant who was known to be boastful and rude. The joke is about an ignorant person calling someone else the same. Bdelycleon had begun to call his father ignorant, but to save himself from the repercussions of insulting his father, he says he himself is no different, like Theogenes.
-
-
#### ll. 1202-1204
Neutral sentiment, although Bdelycleon seems desperate for his father to show some promise in conversational skills, so he rambles off a few ideas, adding to the fun score because it contrasts the things that Philocleon had chosen so far as worthy of sharing. The most recent thing he had shared (taking someone else’s vine poles) only makes him seem lazy, not daring.
#### ll. 1205-1207
Phayllus was a famous athlete. The sentence at first implies that Philocleon once beat him in a race, but then he reveals that he only won a lawsuit against him, which is not as impressive and definitely not cool enough to share at a party. Positive sentiment because this is used as a brag.
-
#### ll. 1219-1222
All of these guests are politicians except for Acestor, implying that this gathering they are imagining is for important people. Acestor’s presence is likely just a jab at Acestor because he was accused of being of foreign origin and not real Athenian, so putting him as an imposter in this imaginary party is fitting.
#### ll. 1228-1230
Almost a warning, although this scenario is fake. Insults him and says bad things will happen to him, so negative sentiment.
-
#### ll. 1253-1255
The realities of a night out drinking, probably drawn from personal experience of Philocleon. The joke does not rely on being clever, but it is still fun because of the relatable nature of it. The audience would likely have found it an amusing statement because they have either been there or witnessed someone act disorderly. Neg sentiment because it describes downsides to the act.
#### ll. 1256-1296
The words γέλοιος (amusing) and γέλως (laughter) are only associated with positive emotions, so they carry positive sentiment in this case. The verb ἀγαθόω (do good to) does as well. Fun score comes from callback to what Philocleon was saying earlier of the defenses he has to listen to where people attempt to use humor to appeal to the jury and get a lesser sentence. Bdelycleon suggests he should do the same in order to save himself if he gets in trouble.
#### ll. 1292-1296
Although we would probably default to feeling bad for the slave today, the original audience probably would have found seeing a beaten slave funny. He is wishing he had a shell so that he could not be as badly beaten. I believe negative sentiment because of his complaints about pain.
#### ll. 1297-1298
Negative sentiment because of the piteous tone. Fun because it appears the chorus is making fun of the slave for being beaten, as if he had control over the matter. 
#### ll. 1326-1331
He strides in and proves that he is as bad as Xanthias claimed. It is funny to see him turn into the type of drunk he was afraid of being. He is already acting violently. The violence accompanies a negative sentiment because its only purpose is to threaten.
#### ll. 1332-1334
An un-fun threat. Philocleon will face negative consequences now (although he did predict this).
#### ll. 1364-1366
Bdelycleon catches Philocleon about to have sex and insults him. The insults add to fun score, as well as the situation itself. Negative sentiment comes from the insults and the threat of consequences due to his actions.
#### ll. 1382-1386
There is obviously a low chance that this old man is going to stand up and land a decent hit like Euphudion because he is drunk, tired, and not a boxer, so the threat is ridiculous.
#### ll. 1388-1391
The joke is now about how much damage he has done in the short time the audience did not see him. He has acted like a delinquent, causing the woman to lose profit, so she is speaking negatively about his actions.
#### ll. 1396-1398
This woman, based on the names of her parents, is a native Athenian and thus she says she must be respected. There’s a possibility that her parents’ names would have been recognized as famous people, so the joke is that she is a mere bread-maker herself. Also, her name, Myrtia, could be an obscene joke, as it sounds similar to several different words that describe different parts of genitalia. It comes from µύρτος (myrtle), a plant sacred to Aphrodite.
#### ll. 1406-1408
Philocleon’s use of Aesop did not go well and only made matters worse, as Myrtia’s reaction shows. Chaerephon was close with Socrates and is mentioned to be by his side in other sources as well. The audience would have suspected that this person on stage was him because of his characteristic paleness. This joke seems to be referencing an incident which has since been lost to time, because it feels incomplete and the presence of Chaerephon is not explained, but the audience probably would have understood.
#### ll. 1409-1411
Philocleon’s tales he is choosing to share only make him seem spiteful and rude, rather than helping his situation. He says them with neutral language, although to the listener it would seem negative.
#### ll. 1413-1414
Philocleon insults Chaerephon by saying he is pale and looks like a woman. Evidently, in order for a woman to bring legal summons, she needs a male witness, and if the jury does not believe Chaerephon is a man because of his pale complexion, the charges will not stand.

Bdelycleon is distressed upon hearing the newest charges because this one has a higher penalty, so he offers to settle instead. In an effort to keep his father from making it worse again, Bdelycleon tells the accuser to talk to him, not Philocleon. Negative sentiment because it shows his frustration.
#### ll. 1421-1425
He confesses this crime and seems to sober up immediately, so the text is conveying a positive sentiment as he decides to make the mistake right.
#### ll. 1427-1432
When you thought Philocleon was done making these drunken mistakes, he decides to share another story that does nothing for his case. He implies that the reason this man is making accusations against him is that he hurt his head while falling off his mount, and that he should go to a doctor to get it fixed. This minimizes Philocleon’s blame in the whole thing, effectively retracting the act of taking responsibility from before.
#### ll. 1462-1473
The chorus gives many compliments to Bdelycleon. Sentiment is positive as they speak very positively about him, and the fun is low because of the straightforward nature.
#### ll. 1474-1481
Thespis is considered the founder of Athenian tragedy. Philocleon is doing old dances now that he is home and won’t stop, which disgruntles Xanthias, causing him to complain. A little bit of fluff here intended for comedy.

Carcinus is the name of a dramatist. His sons were known to be talented dancers and were very short. Carcinus means “crab,” so naturally all of the “sons of Carcinus” are dressed as crabs. The joke relies on the fact that these men would be dressed as crabs. This is why Philocleon seems to be planning on eating the competition. Here, he is taunting because his confidence in himself is so high, so I believe it to be a positive sentiment. The puns make the fun score.
#### ll. 1529-1537
The claim that choruses do not go off dancing at the end of comedies could be a lie, but we do not know. The line is all fluff. Certain dance moves are described, only for the chorus to say that they will not in fact be participating, making the idea seem ridiculous.
