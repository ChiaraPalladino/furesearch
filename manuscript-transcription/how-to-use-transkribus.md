## First Use Information
This is how your homepage should look after logging into Transkribus

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0674fcc6-90f7-4ca7-ba31-68cd5295bc4f" width=60% height=60%>

* In the top left corner, there are 3 main sections you can go to in Transkribus: "Home", "Collections", and "Tags"  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ad32762-6a16-41d7-a4cf-d84b84da9868" width=30% height=30%>

* To access all Camerarius documents, click on "Collections". You will find a personal collection, a test, and the "Digital Camerarius" collection.
* The Digital Camerarius collection is currently where all our transcription work is being done.
* The "Test" collection is available for first-time users to play around with the tools Transkribus offers, without having to worry about messing up pages we are currently working on. Anything in the "Test" collection is allowed to be modified, deleted, or changed.

* The Camerarius collection is divided into sections to maintain order with page/emblem transcription. When uploading entries (emblem and page(s)), be sure to do the same.

* To change the name of the sections, simply click the three dots on the bottom right of the section

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7967cd91-f67f-4d9a-ba88-85b7a22a2ffa" width=40% height=40%>  

* Then, click "Edit Metadata".
  
* From there you can change the Title, add a description, etc.  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178754a3-5e08-4fdb-a94f-f1fa4fbf6dde" width=50% height=50%>  

* Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Save". 

## Uploading and managing documents 

* From the Homepage, click on "Upload Files" in the top right corner
  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a405bb7-7d9b-4ec3-bedf-03ef2794dffb" width=40% height=40%>

* Select the collection for your documents and add appropriate metadata in the boxes  
* You can either drag and drop your files directly into Transkribus, or click browse and choose from your own files.
* Click submit and wait for your documents to upload.  

## Using an automatic transcription and layout model 
In order to generate a transcription using an AI text recognition model, you can go about it two ways.

#### For one page
* Open the page you want to transcribe and click on the "Start automatic transcription" button
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0471e2c7-74cf-444d-a115-3cb0ded2f650" width=40% height=40%>

* This will bring you to a page that lists all available public models to use. For the Camerarius project, we are using the Noscemus GM 6 model.
* Select the text model and click "Start Recognition" in the top right corner
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cccf092e-162c-42f4-8a7b-860423ce3a0f" width=40% height=40%>


#### For multiple pages 

* Check the box in the bottom left corner of each page you want transcribed
  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d07dc0f0-b288-4ff0-a902-0652e5454bf7" width=40% height=40%>

* Then click the "[T] Recognize" button. This will bring you to the text recognition model page
  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4765e735-1261-404a-8ce6-7ce636fefa38" width=20% height=20%>
  
* Select text model and start recognition. 

#### Information on Noscemus GM 6
* Trained on Antiqua-based print 
* Recognizes Greek shorthand: -ος ending
* Recognizes Latin shorthand: et symbol, shorthand for atque (atq), long 's'
* Seems to have the most issues recognizing accents (eg. putting an accent where it isn't, leaving out accents, or putting in the wrong accents)
* Has problems mixing up lower-case 'e' with 'a' or 'o'

## Transcribing a page 

* To add/create a line, go to the far left toolbar and click on "Add a Line"
* Click once on the place you want your line to start, then click twice where you want your line to stop.
* The same applies when creating a region

## How to enable tags
* To tag something in your transcription, you must enable tags first. To do so, go to the bar on the far right of your transcription page and click the arrow that says "Tags".  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a71b28b-3276-47f3-90e6-c8faceeef9f9" width=15% height=15%>   

* Highlight your desired word(s) with your mouse. This will generate an array of available tags. In this example, you would use the "Language" tag   

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf0168a-8d8e-47ea-bc0d-ab61c23e82eb" width=40% height=40%>    

* Simply click on the desired tag and fill whatever information that tag needs. Here, the you would enter "Ancient Greek" as the language. For more information on how to use the specific tags, see the Transcription Guidelines.

### Creating and Editing tags
* To create tags, click on the "Tags" button in the top left of your dashboard.
* Select the "Digital Camerarius" collection.
* It will bring you to a page that allows you to manage your tags, change elements from pre-existing tags, create, and delete tags.
* There are two kinds of tags we use: textual and structural

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec0349fc-096e-4d26-9908-b9fd54da2cd2" width=30% height=30%>   

* The drop down allows you to switch between viewing your structural tags, and your textual tags. **Textual tags** are used for semantic markup, e.g. indicating persons, authors, citations and quotations, while **Structural tags** are used to markup the text layour and structure, including headers, titles, captions, and figures. 

* To create new tags, simply click on the "Create New" button right next to the drop down.
* You can name the tag, choose the color it will show up as, and add atributes to the tag.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908c2c95-e020-42a4-8b78-134fcddb1126" width=35% height=35%>   

* When you are satisfied with your tag, click the "Create" button at the bottom of the page. You may need to refresh Transkribus a few times before it shows up in your collection.
* To edit tags, simply click the pencil on whatever tag you want to change. Once done, click "Save". <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7fbda1-1cd5-4774-8f22-7d92c1394a57" width=5% height=5%>   

### Getting your new tags in text  

* When you create a new tag, it will not show up immediately on your page. You must open your transcription first, and highlight the word(s) you want to tag.
* Instead of choosing a tag, click on "Tag Settings"

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c083500-e652-4278-a56c-c8c63147222d" width=30% height=30%>   

* This will bring you to a page comprising of all the tags you have made for that collection. Just like the big Tag section, you can also switch between textual and structural tags using the drop down.
* Then, click the button in the "Visibility" column. This will make the tag "visible" in your collection.

## Transkribus shortcuts and info:

To divide a region or line:
* click on region/line of interest
* press and hold V (vertical) or H (horizontal)
* use slider to make your split

To move a region or line:
* click on region/line
* press and hold shift
* use slider to move up, down, expand, or minimize

Three dots in top right corner shows extra keyboard shortcuts

"Jobs" button shows progress on an automatic transcription

The hamburger on the right is the "Layout" button. This allows you to change the order of lines in your transcription. 

## Observations about Transkribus:
It sometimes randomly deletes tags I've created 
* solution: make sure you click somewhere else on your transcription so the software registers it as a "change" before you save and exit.

Transkribus has a number of keyboard shortcuts to be used in transcriptions. The problem with this is that some of the shortcuts only require you to press a certain letter on your keyboard (ie. pressing W allows you to zoom out) which has proven to be an issue when I am trying to fix mistakes or put info into tags that use that letter. 

It is VERY reliant on how good your wifi/cell service is. 

Be sure to save as you work. If you wait till you are done with a document, the software will freak out and won't save your work. I usually click save every 5-10 changes just to be safe.
