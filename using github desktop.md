# How to use GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is the application you will use to upload new data for your projects. Doing things this way will help you with versioning, as GitHub will record every change to the file. 

Download and install GitHub Desktop, and log in with your GitHub credentials: https://desktop.github.com/

## Clone this repository on GitHub Desktop

From the application, click on the menu in the upper left corner and select the "Add" menu. Then click on **clone repository**

This will open another view where you will be able to add this repository. Chances are you will be able to find it immediately. If you are, just click on it.

**It is very important that you select a location that you can find in your computer, that is NOT on the Desktop, and that is not full of other stuff**. The best option is to create a specific GitHub folder somewhere, for example in your Documents folder. 

**NEVER make changes to the local files on your computer. DO NOT delete them, do not create new ones, do not work with them in any way. ONLY change files directly in the repository from the browser.**

## Update your local repository 

Whenever changes are made on GitHub, you need to bring your local folders up to date. When you open the GitHub application, click on "Fetch origin".
