# How to use this project page: a tutorial

Welcome to the Project page for this research repository. Here you will be able to keep track and provide status updates about your project. 

### Accessing the project page 

* From the GitHub Repository home page, click on Projects in the menu bar and click on "FU Research Project Management".

* Go to the view "Project Roadmap". This is really the only view you will need. It contains a list of the tasks and assignees.

### Changing the status of a project task

If you want to change the status of a task and record it as to do, done or in progress, simply go to the "Status" column and select the tag in the dropdown menu.

### Editing a project task 

* Project tasks are usually divided by weeks, to reflect your internal project roadmap. You can change this division by adding more tasks and locating them on the calendar, but generally this is not necessary. 
* From the project roadmap view, click on a task under the column "Title".

* From this pop up, you can edit the title, add more information on the task, and so on. You can always go back to this task and add comments and updates.

### If you have an issue or question, or are experiencing a bug related to a project task 

* Click again on the editing view and select "convert to issue" in the menu on the right, then click on "furesearch".

* Once you have clicked on "furesearch", **add the relevant label of your project**: sentiment analysis, manuscript transcription, geoannotation, etc. Also add any other relevant tag, such as "bug", "question", etc.

* Great! Now you have created an issue, which will be displayed in the FUResearch repository: https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/issues

* You can always edit the text of this issue, change the labels, add a status, record a milestone (e.g. "first 100 sentences completed") and so on. You can do that from the Project page, or from the specific Issue that you have opened on the Issues page (I recommend doing it from the Issues).
