Violence Within the Text - 
When going through this text it became clear that violence needed to be documented in some form. To do this I added a column to the spreadsheet to address the presence of violence. I chose to assign each sentence a violence score. The scores range from 0-2, a score of zero indicates that there is no violence present in the sentence. A score of 1 indicates that there is violent language being used in a descriptive manner. A score of 2 indicates that there is active violence occurring within the sentence. This classification might be adjusted as needed as I implement it further.
