# Mapping Commentary (and Points for Review)
### This is an aggregate of all of my commentary in mapping the _Anabasis_, similar to my notable annotations and commentary list, mostly so that it's on record.

## Book 2
* I’m having Book 2 start at the reference point Pleiades gives for the wall of Media (33.1216, 44.2698) and not where Wikipedia roughly lists the Battle of Cunaxa as having occurred (33.325, 44.08) because:
    * It’s where I left off in book 1
    * **The Pleiades reference point is not actually the Median Wall**, but the defensive ditch Artaxerxes II carved that reaches to it, that Pleiades labels the Wall of Media. The actual Median Wall may be a bit further south/southeast, since it’s only said to be “where the length between the Tigris and Euphrates narrows considerably”
* The Battle of Cunaxa is stated to have happened on the left bank of the Euphrates, yet the coords for it place it almost directly between the Tigris and Euphrates
    * Towards the beginning of book 2, Xenophon states that the journey from Ephesus to the battlefield  has been 93 stages/535 parasangs/16,050 stadia, and from the battlefield to Babylon is 360 stadia
        * Now stadia nor parasangs nor stages are precise measurements that we can directly calculate to the modern day, BUT if we work within a range of values (1 parasang = 4.7-5.6km) (1 stadion = 150-210m) (1 stage=29.8km), this area seems reasonable. From this battlefield point, the center of Babylon is ~66.45km away, which is already within the range given, not accounting for whether it was measured from the battlefield to the city walls or city center, how big and where the battlefield was, etc., which are accommodated to a reasonable extent
    * HOWEVER, in Book 1 they don’t actually reach the Wall of Media itself, but a defensive canal dug near it
    * Furthermore, in Book 2 it’s implied they travel at least a little bit until they reach the Wall of Media
    * MY CURRENT THEORY is that the Pleiades point for the Wall of Media is part of the defensive canal that flows northwest to southeast, semi-parallel to the Euphrates (since it’s said it empties into the Euphrates, or at the very least gets very close, creating a passage only about 20 (greek?) feet in width) 
        * In Book 1 Cyrus is said to have traveled for 3 days, growing more lax in defense each day, but no measurements are given until well after he’s dead, when Artaxerxes II’s troops storm Cyrus’ and Ariaeus’ camp, and the soldiers retreat to their setting-off point earlier in the day (which was about 4 parasangs away)
        * Given that he was likely marching towards Babylon, they probably traveled south from the Pleiades Wall of Media reference point, fought near the bend in the Euphrates where the Median Wall may actually be (or at least before the space between the Euphrates and Tigris widens again), then the soldiers backtracked and fled up ~4 parasangs
         * Given all that, they potentially backtracked back to the reference point, so I will be starting Book 2 from this reference point
* Given the almost contemporary status of Xenophon and Herodotus, the two Greek authors to earliest and widely make use of parasangs in their writings, and given the pre existing scholarship on the topic (Rood, T. (2010). Xenophon's parasangs. https://doi.org/10.1017/s0075426910000042), I’m going to go with the idea that parasangs are variable, and I am going to borrow Herodotus’ assertion that an “army moves [roughy] 5 parasangs per day” when trying to calculate distances where Xenophon measures in days (such as the beginning of book 2)
    * Applies to 2.2.13 march
    * For 2.3.14 guided march, no days nor distance is given, so I’m assuming half a day at most, though it could be less because maybe Xenophon didn’t think it was enough to merit measurements
        * Also the direction is up in the air. Since they have to eventually get to Opis, and the king is guiding them and is based out of Babylon, south/southeast felt like a solid guess
* From the 2.3.14 villages they encounter the actual Median Wall after marching 3 stages. Even with the most conservative measure of distance, this is an absurdly huge zone. Even if my previous estimations (where they first encountered the trench, the battlefield location, their falling back point) are, which to an extent they no-doubt are, they would have to be wrong by such a wide margin that it contradicts measurements Xenophon previously gave. Maybe an instance of Xenophon forgot?
    * Now here’s a thought. Xenophon says it’s “not too far distant from Babylon” (2.4.12), and there are so many different rivers and tributaries in this area. The Wall is said to be built at a narrowing of the Tigris and Euphrates, but where this area would seem to be doesn’t make sense geographically. However, if it was between two tributaries of the Tigris and Euphrates, or rivers that were mistaken as the two, it could be much closer to Babylon and potentially line up with the measurements more.
        * Highly unlikely that people have been misidentifying the location for ~2500 years, and this thought fully comes from trying to treat subjective measurements as objective, but I’m coping okay
* The measurements here are all sorts of wonky. This part actually lines up reasonably with where I put the Median Wall, and therefore where they would’ve passed inside, but that also contradicts the measurements given before and after
* Where I estimated Sittace to be on the map that makes sense with Xenophon’s journey measurements, the fact that they haven’t crossed the Tigris yet (ie on the Babylon side), and 15 stadia (2.25km) from the river
    * HOWEVER, that’s not particularly in the bounds of Sittacene as it’s represented on Pleiades, so who knows, this whole section is going to have to be heavily reviewed anyway
* The measurements Xenophon gives from Sittace to Opis all like eight degrees of wonked, and there’s just no way they work geographically. I desperately need to review and basically redo this entire section, since right now the only possible way it works is: Opis is misidentified (either by Xenophon or modern day scholars), all the preceding measurements are wrong, or Xenophon is extremely wrong right now
* Distance from Opis to “villages of Parysatis” (2.4.27) lines up refreshingly well. If anything, it might be a bit short (potentially due to “desert stages”; I assume they can cover greater distances on flat desert terrain?)
    * Nevermind it actually might be nowhere near long enough, because immediately after it says they pass by Cenae in the first stage of their 4 desert stage march, and where these villages are estimated right now they can barely even reach Cenae by the end of the march
* As it stands, they have to get to the Zapatas river (2.5.1) by the end of Book 2, so measurements be damned I put them there
