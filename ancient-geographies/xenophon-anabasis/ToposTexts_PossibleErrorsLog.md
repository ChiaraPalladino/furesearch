# ToposText Potentially Erroneous Wikidata ID's + Misc. Other Errors
## This document includes entities that have Wikidata ID's that I believe to be erroneous, along with an explanation why, as well as other potential errors.

### Book 1
* (1.4.5) "Syrian Gates" maps on to Belen Pass, not what it's referring to which is the Syrian side of the Cilicia-Syria Gates. It likely fetches it's data from the Pleiades-658606 Syriai Pylai rather than the appropriate Pleiades-650508 Kilikiai Pylai.

### Book 5
* (5.1.2) Random "2" after the sentence.
*  (5.6.4) There is a random "24" in the middle of the words.
* (5.6.24) Another random "29"
> Both of these are likely cleaning errors from reformatting.

### Book 6
* (6.3.5) The Wikidata ID linked is for Hegesander of Delphi, some ~150 years after the events of the *Anabasis*.
* (6.5.7) Rhathines should be linked to the Wikidata entry Ratines (Q11944935) (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11944935).

### Book 7
* (7.3.28) The Wikidata ID linked is for Gnesippus, the Doric poet, while the Gnesippus mentioned by Xenophon is an Athenian member of his army.
> The (admittedly scant) knowledge of dates for Doric Gnesippus means it could theoretically be the same person, as he is potentially alive during the events of the *Anabasis*, but the lack of any other supporting evidence makes this unlikely.
