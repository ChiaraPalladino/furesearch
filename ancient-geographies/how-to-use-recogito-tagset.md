# How to use the Recogito Tagset

This short guide will explain how to upload the Tagset we use in the Guidelines. It will give you a predefined list of tags to use, if you don't want to type tags or find available combinations.   

You can always add new tags and use the old ones you had before! This is just a predefined list to make things easier.  

You also will always be able to change this tagset, clear it, and reupload it in Recogito. You won't lose the tags you assigned in your annotations.   

Download the file "recogito tagset" in your computer. 

In your Recogito document, go to "Annotation Preferences" and select "Upload from file" under Tagging Vocabulary.

Upload the file "recogito tagset". You will see the tagset is immediately displayed. You don't need to do anything more! It is automatically saved.

Now every time you make a new annotation, you will have access to this list of tags.
